        "rating": "10",
        "review": "Forget what the critic is saying , this might be a movie the critics will not like but the fan they will definitely like it. It's a different approach taken by Anand L rai and charismatic srk. With the combination of anushka and katrina , the movie gets back on the line. When the trailer came out we all thought it will be a huge comedy, but it's not just a comedy it's a very very emotional movie.I would like to urge people go to cinema and watch this beautiful film."

        "review": "First half and initial part of second half is so awwwwwsome 10/10. Haven't laughed this much during a movie in years. Second half is stretched and feels less relevant and less funny. Such good graphics is rare for a bollywood movie. Acting is top notch 10 for Srk, 11 for Anushka and 8 for Katrina. Songs are adequate and well adapted. Story is average because of second half. It's a good one-time watch. A must watch for SRK fans."

        "title": " A weird, disastrous film",
        "rating": "4",
        "review": "Zero was a weird film. Like REALLY WEIRD. It's not as bad as Race 3 (which made me stop watching Hindi movies for 6 months), but it's not groundbreaking either. Which is a shame really, because Shah Rukh Khan can do better films than this.Shah Rukh Khan really had energy in his performance. Even though he's 53, he still has the energy that makes me smile. üòÉ Surprisingly, Katrina Kaif was far better than Anushka Sharma. In my opinion, Anushka's acting was a bit over-the top. Others were fine I guess. (SRK's friend, played by Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub was a laugh riot! Perfect comic timing and the brightest spot of the film.)Story was a letdown. It was an old-people romance, The Martian copy and Bollywood Insider unevenly mashed up into one. SRK, I know you're the king of romance. But why go back to garbage lover-boy films that don't work anymore? Find a new niche. You can easily play a romance mentor (like in Dear Zindagi), or even something innovative that doesn't involve romance. Zero may have been innovative, but it wasn't a good risk at all. If you wanted to do an astronaut film, you should have just stuck to that rather than mix it with small-town romance and B-town scandal.The only saving grace of the film is its soundtrack, which easily contains the best songs of the year. \"Mere Naam Tu\", \"Issaqbaazi\" and \"Husn Parcham\" are songs that will really give you earworms and stick with you long after the film ends. However, the film is disastrous as a whole. It's better to stream it instead of paying for a ticket."
