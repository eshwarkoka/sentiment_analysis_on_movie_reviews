        "review": "I was Dumbstruck when I saw this movie at theater. M.Raja has indeed grown a long way from being a 'remake' director to his 'own make' director. The base script is usual one - good vs bad. But the way it has been scripted especially the bad part, deserves standing ovation!PROS:Aravind Samy - dashing stylish villain is everyones favorite and he doesn't disappoint you ! This villain is very unique! He didn't lay his hand on the protagonist at all! not even for a single shot. He carried the bad role in a subtle but powerful manner! You will surely fall in love with this character!Thambi Ramayyah - humour is different from comedy and he is the trump card in this movie who keeps on giving us some enjoyable part with his innocence. Jayam Ravi - He worked very hard for this movie! It is evident from the word go itself. This is a tailor made role for him and he did exceed the expectations.Atlast, Raja - scripting a detailed cop thriller with pacey screenplay is very difficult and he succeeds very much here!Very good movie after Thuppaki which should be watched in theaters purely for its excellence in story telling!This is a smartly made movie though not a genius film!Kudos to the whole team! Very happy to watch a very good thriller."

        "review": "The movie title itself gave me goose bumps. A thriller is expected after all the promotions. But a thriller with a true meaning and less illogicalstuffs is Thani oruvan. The twist in the beginning scene itself will make you understand what you will watch for the next 2 hours. More than Ravi his brother deserves the applause for scripting something original and keeping the audience thrilled till the end. That's something very rare. But he managed to do that in this flick. But the next main person who should be saluted,awarded,appreciated,loved,and of course all the other synonyms is Aravind Swamy. Can a villain be so loved by everyone?. I think that has happened now. Performance to a next level. Ravi has done a commendable job in first choosing such a script which has more importance to the villain than the hero. And of course at the end everyone will appreciate the only performance which stands out that is Sidharth Abimanyu. An enjoyable ride. I am sure all will love it..."

Mohan Raja proved the best of his talent and Music/ BGM by Hiphop Tamilzha Aadhi is awesome too.Best movie scene... - When child Sidharth Abhimanyu speaking of the deal for his father to take the blame from Naser. - When Sidharth Abhimanyu got shot by his lover and lying on lap of Jayam Ravi with the last dialog was simply superb.Worth of every penny!"

Jeyam Ravi is doing the finest job over here as the hero while Arvind Swamy doing a magnificent role over the villain. Nayanthara is bit small character in here as Mithran's girlfriend &amp; the director should focus to take much more from her. And a word about the director, M. Raja has proved that he can do many things more than re-making old movies. And the musics were very good &amp; synchronized with the movement of the movie. and the finally, I would say that this movie is worth watching. You have to spent 2hours and 37 minutes. but it deserve it."

        "rating": "7",
        "review": "A well enacted thriller with a racy screen play portrays the war between the good and the bad (evil). Jayam Ravi's brother Director M.Raja has given so many hits but most of them would be remakes of success films in Telugu. This time he has took quite time to pen his story and screenplay after his last venture Velayudham starting Vijay which has worked quite well even though the basic concept is the same cat and mouse game. Corruption, Corporate mafia, underworld, Pharmaceutical Company's illegal research, Goons, Strict and straight forward IAS, IPS officers working with anti corruption motto, realistic fight with corporate Dons, A Solo Hero with a vision and a supportive lead lady some of the keywords that can describe this movie's plot. The ultimate show stopper of the movie was the performance of the antagonist played by none other than the yester year's charming hero Aravind Samy. He plays Siddharth Abimanyu a suave middle aged notorious scientist and has lifted the role to a different level with his charisma in a sophisticated set up. His comeback as a good hearted priest didn't work out in Kadal but sure this negative role will be a break through character in his career. Mithran (essayed by Jayam ravi ) is the best cop ever who shadows his aim case and moves exactly with his supporting team of friends. Mahima (played by the beautiful dusky Nayantara) who is head over heels with Mithran supports him with her skills. The overall love sequences seemed sensible and mature didn't bore us with instant dream sequences except the one and only song which was bearable. Other than these leads we have Nasser, Thambi Rammaiah (don't know how many movies he will play the same innocent character with the same tone), Vamsi Krishna, Ganesh Venkat Ram, Jay Prakash, Mugdha Godse (of the Hindi movie Fashion fame). On the technical bit like cinematography, editing, BGM, Arts was in place and gave what was needed for a script like this. Except a bit on editing would have made it look perfect. At times it would make you feel and compare portions with Kakha kakha and similar cop movie series, plus Ramana, Nimirndhu nil, E, Thupakki etc Verdict: A good thriller with an over shadowed antagonist which is the current trend where villain takes over easily."

        "review": "As we all witnessed during the past 10 days or so, 'Thani Oruvan' got rave reviews and has been accepted by the film industry and audience as a benchmark movie. There is a transition happening in the Indian movie industry; that is driven by the audience. Today movie goers are well aware of the worldly events. The life-cycle of audience taste is short, meaning audience preference is undergoing change at a higher rate than ever before. The typical romance movie is no longer going to pull the audience. It had been already exploited by the uncountable number of movies in all the possible formats. So what is next? That is called 'Thani Oruvan' way! - A strong theme, embedded with authentic data &amp; logic. How it all started? Way back in 2013, director Mr. Mohan Raja met with a group of consultants from Fhyzics Business Consultants Pvt. Ltd., specializes in business consulting and business analysis (An EEP of International Institute of Business Analysis, Canada and REP of International Requirements Engineering Board, Germany). By that time, Mr. Raja was thinking about the story for at least 3 years. The one question he asked the group of consultants was \"I want to make the movie authentic and different, how you could contribute?\" Fhyzics was also looking for opportunities to explore the movie industry. Subsequently, Fhyzics team met the director few times and demonstrated how they can make it different. It clicked, and Fhyzics got its maiden movie project. The assignment given to Fhyzics team is data and logic research for the movie project. The team researched the IPS training, minute-by- minute daily routines of IPS probationers and officers, costumes, usage of words &amp; terminologies, technologies, background, analysis methods etc. The team also did intensive research on crimes both at national and international level from 1990 onwards to till-date. Organized the crimes under different heads and drawn the linkages. Prepared crime charts, time-to-time emotional graphs, hero vs. villain rise &amp; fall maps etc. Even Fhyzics created a PPT that was presented to the producers by Mr. Raja to give them a holistic view of the movie. Massive amount of data and information were collected, organized in SharePoint (a Microsoft technology), then distilled and presented on weekly basis to the director for the entire duration of the movie making and it has been judiciously consumed in the movie without affecting the entertainment element of it. At Fhyzics, we profoundly thank Mr. Raja for the opportunity and helping us in launching our services in the movie industry with this landmark movie, 'Thani Oruvan'.

        "review": "Cent percent worth the expectations,Mohan Raja's Thani Oruvan puts an end to the long wait for a neat thriller from Kollywood and delivers two memorable characters Mithran I.PS and Siddharth Abhimanyu,portrayed by Jayam Ravi and Arvind Swami respectively.A brilliantly crafted thriller with intelligent screenplay and terrific narration,Thani Ourvan is a delightful original offering from Raja who's know for remaking successful films from other languages down south.The screenplay by director himself and the writer duo Subha framed upon the cat and mouse chase between protagonist and the villain is immensely stylish and substantial,being successful in gaining attention of the viewers who gets to be a part of the proceedings.There isn't a single dull moment in around 160 minutes of the running time and leaving aside some minor glitches,Thani Oruvan stands out as one of the best thrillers ever produced in Kollywood for its racy script,powerful and meaningful dialogues,lack of unwanted elements aimed at masses,the brilliant performances and strong technical perfection.Unlike many thrillers produced in the recent past,the romance portions were well-written and Raja deserves a special applause for handling it convincingly so that it never turn a stumbling block in the thrills offered by the enthralling fight between the hero and the villain.Jayam Ravi has comeup with a top-notch performance as the protagonist Mithran IPS and showcases his mettle in handling intense roles with ease.Expecting more such roles from him rather than disappointing ones like Shakti from 'Sakalakala Vallavan Appatakkar'. Casting Aravind Swami as the suave,intelligent and cool antagonist worked out wonders and he stole the show with his matured act.Arvind's character Siddharth Abhimanyu will be long-remembered as one of the best villainous portrayals in the history of tamil film industry.Welcome Back Swami!! Choose Wisely and you are here to stay !! &lt;3 Thambi Ramaiah managed to evoke laughs with his hilarious portrayal of Sengalvarayan.Nayan Thara as the heroine was convincing in a neatly written role and pulled off her part really well.The supporting cast that includes Rahul Madhav,Ganesh Venkatraman etc were good.Music and score by Hip-Hop Tamizha were effective and gave more depth to the narration.All the songs were perfectly placed and avoiding unnecessary item songs and other unwanted numbers proved good for tightening the screenplay.Frames by Rajaji were slick and cuts by Gopi Krishna were neat.Overall,Thani Oruvan is a stylish and captivating thriller,a must watch this season.Verdict:: Mind-blowing performances from Jayam Ravi and Arvind Swami backed up with a taut screenplay,technical brilliance,powerful dialogues and and an energetic score makes Thani Oruvan an easy addition to the list of best thrillers to come-out from Kollywood till date.Don't miss this one from theatres,Period!! Un Yedhiri Yaar Endru Sol..Nee Yaar Endru Solgiren B-)"

The last song was also good and peppy. Hope this will change the attitude of most of the tamil directors, as long as the story is good and well narrated, it will be a big hit. This also proves, a movie with unrealistic scenes and characters can be successful and in fact hugely successful movie. Big kudos to the entire Thani Oruvan team. All the best.."

Go for it!There is no speed breaker &amp; a perfect song placement The Villain's character is well designed and more special from other negative characters of Kollywood Cinema.This movie is totally different from M.Raja's earlier movies.Unexpected turnings and easily catch-able screenplay.The best movie of this kind \"GOOD vs EVIL\".You'll have no reason to hate this film. This movie is a 'Gem Of Tamil Cinema'. Must watch movie for all movie lovers.Don't Miss this Roller Coaster Ride :)"

He has a skill developed since his childhood to read media news between the lines and strongly believes every small-time crime news item appearing has at its back hidden an organised crime. His skills of reading between lines, connecting the dots &amp; of course the never dying passion, brings him into the battleground with one Siddarth.Also imagine a criminal, who plans more on covering himself from the crimes he masterminds, than on the crime itself. He is one helluva opportunist, who takes birth in a minister's car with the siren on, does an unimaginable cease of an opportunity at age 15, and controls the powerhouse of politics, business and research together through his allies and alas, he is a renowned scientist. His smooth flow gets perturbed on one Dec. 10, when his plan to discourage announcement of generic drugs by a swiss pharma owner lady gets deviated for a while, and he is in the battleground with our cop Mitran.Thani Oruvan is likable for every aspect of it. I generally judge a Director's capacity in creating the unique personality for his characters and ensuring the character maintains the same throughout the plot. M Raja &amp; SuBa get 5 star on this aspect. The way the traits of both Ravi &amp; Aravind are etched and maintained through shows the efficiency.Aravind Swamy (of Roja fame) is a real discovery in the role of Antagonist (or should we say, the protagonist? I wonder, why not?). He will actually make us like the villain of the movie more than the hero. Quiet a contrary. The crisp &amp; slow delivery of simple, yet powerful dialogues between him &amp; his father (played by Thambi Ramayya) are treat. Of course, Ravi &amp; Nayantara have done their best as usual. Never loses curiosity. No loopholes in the story. No mediocrity in production values. Limited but essential use of CG. Lot of research has gone in to connect current affairs to hypothesis.In conclusion, its not everyday we get such treat from Indian movie makers...get yourself feasted..."

Personally I would like movie makers to control the itch to add the artificial fights and the out-of-screenplay songs. Imagine the depth of the movie without those and a bit more of logical screenplay wow, then we are talking of a masterpiece. But it was a genuinely good feeling coming out of the movie and yes not everyone in the audience would enjoy a total logical package so I think its a class 1 entertainer and Arvind Swamy and Ravi have done exceedingly well. The lead actress Nayanthara to her credit also supports very well to the plot. Must watch!"

The facts are also well-researched.\n2) Role Selection - For action thrillers such as this, the characters will make or break a movie. Thankfully, all the actors fit their roles nicely. Even heroine's role is not wasted.\n3) Arvind Swamy - This man is a revelation! From a chocolate boy to a Menacing Villain, his transformation is Extraordinary!\n4) Villain's role - For any action movies, the villains need to be stronger and smarter than the hero so that audience will be engaged. THIS MOVIE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE ON HOW VILLAIN ROLES SHOULD BE WRITTEN! A villain does not need to look terrifying, no need to have six packs, no need to have fighting skills, does not have to shout at everyone around him etc. He just needs to have an evil mindset and does not stop at anything to achieve his dreams. An interesting thing in this movie is that there are no fight scenes between the hero and villain and the villain does not even utter a single cuss word. Heck he won't even raise his voice to the hero. But yet, he is the greatest evil. In the villain's own words - \"I'm not bad, just evil\" (Telugu cinema should learn to improve their villain roles from this movie)\n5) Hip Hop Tamizha - This young chap is the GREATEST ASSET of this movie! Right from the BGM, the songs and the movie's theme \"Theemai dhaan vellum\", he has further elevated this movie to a different level. His BGM everytime Arvind Swamy appears on screen is worth special mention. The usage of the theme song as BGM for the interval and climax scenes is a MasterTouch! He deserved a National Award for this movie.\n6) Nayanthara - Unlike typical heroines, Nayanthara's role is rather important and she provides some of the comic relief in this movie. \n7) Thambi Ramaiah - This is his best role since Myna. As a naive father to the world's greatest villain, his counter-punch and the way he shivers infront of his own son are praiseworthy. Cons:\n1) NONEThis is one of the best Tamil movies ever made. Actually scratch that, this is one the BEST INDIAN MOVIE ever! A case study on how cop thrillers should be made, how villain roles should be written, how a BGM should sound like and how to include Mass elements without going over the top. DO NOT MISS IT!"

        "review": "Finally we have an original screenplay and idea from Mohan Raja, and a great one at that. Thani oruvan narrates the story of Mithran, a cop who becomes obsessed with bringing down India's most corrupt businessman, Sidharth Abhimanyu and displays the psychological cat and mouse game that enfolds. Although its presented as usual in the good versus evil form the underlying political core of this film was very intriguing: The invisble but ever looming connection between seemingly small street crimes, media, politicians and businessmen. Here, M.Raja explores the decaying corruption of the pharmaceutical industry. The pace of the film is very fast paced, and rarely lags, constantly putting the audience into situation after situation where we see the psychological battle between Mithran and Sidharth Abhimanyu play out, with building tension, suspense and sudden twists. The opening scene of the film itself is very unique and establishes an unexpected character in the film.Likewise the film builds to an unexpected but impactful climax. Yes, sometimes the film becomes preachy, with Jayam Ravi giving passionate monologues, however this doesn't take away too much from the film. The dialogues in general are very crisp and striking. The charachterisation in this film is mostly good. Whereas Sidharth Abhimanyu is a trendsetting villain who will undoubtedly go down as one of the most badass villains in tamil cinema, the same cannot be said of Mithran's character. Mithran's character is slightly more fleshed out than other cliched Do gooder heroes of Kollywood. We see glimpses of his obsession to bring down Sidharth Abhimanyu, particularly in an intense scene where he almost destroys his own apartment searching for a bug. However this obsession could have been more fleshed out to the extent that Mithran himself ends up making morally questionable decisions to arrest his personally assigned enemy. Jayam Ravi's performance is good but lies in the shadow of Arvind Swamy's understated and badass performance as Sidharth Abhimanyu, a ruthless, calculating, manipulative and opportunistic businessman. The supporting cast are also good and help to progress the narrative. Especially Rahul Madhav as Jana, Nasser as the chief minister and Thambi Ramaiah are very good. Nayanthara isnt a cliched heroine just there for commercial purposes. Although her role is more commercial (as usual a duet but at least only one) at least her character had a role and was more integrated into the story, and her performance was good so the romance portion wasn't too irritating or irrelevant.Hip Hop Tamizha's music is very good, the songs are catchy and memorable and the bgm is excellent, especially Theemai dhan vellum and \"Thani Oruvan\" both themes are brilliant and emit expected vibes; Dark and badass, and Awesome in a motivating way. Technically the film is sound. The editing is great and so is the cinematography especially with the colour tones and shades.Overall, Thani oruvan is a film one can watch many times and is racy, sleek and thrilling, featuring a stellar comeback from Arvind Swamy as well as politically astute themes,"
