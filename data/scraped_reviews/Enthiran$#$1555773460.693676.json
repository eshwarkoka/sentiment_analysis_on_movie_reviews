        "review": "Enthiran will keep u by your seats till the end.The movie plot is decent and the superb directing by Shankar along with our superstar Rajini's acting makes this a masterpiece.....  I saw this movie on first day at pondicherry and i never seen a crowd like this before.  The film's story revolves around a scientist's struggle to control his creation, an android robot whose processor was upgraded to give it the ability to comprehend and generate human emotions, from further sociological mishaps. After setting its eyes upon a beautiful woman, the robot develops love for her, who also happens to be the love interest of the scientist, which creates a conflict between the two. It released worldwide on 1 October 2010...........  A must see film..............."

        "review": "All is grand and great with 'Enthiran'. From frame one till the last, there is enough thrill, spill and chill that one would normally associate with Rajinikanth. Perhaps it is double here. The magic of Rajinikanth and the aura of Shankar have been combined well to weave a magic on screen.  Come to describe Rajinikanth in Enthiran, we may run short of adjectives and adverbs. As scientist Vaseegaran and as robot Chitti, the top actor sizzles. He is cool and suave as Vaseegaran. More intellectual and stylish, he charms one and all.  Sporting a stylish beard, Rajinikanth appears in trendy costumes in flashy colours. He has exemplary energy and enormous screen presence quite like any other films of him in the past.  Not far behind is beautiful Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who missed few chances before to act with Rajinikanth. In 'Enthiran', she is cool and casual. The beauty with brains lends dignity to her role.  Walking away with applause is Mozart of Madras A R Rahman. All his songs are catchy, foot-tapping and trendy. The songs like 'Kadhal Anukkal.', 'Robo Dance', 'Boom Boom' or 'Kilimanjaro', all evoke thunderous applause. Rahman's mastery in blending orchestration, harmony and rhythm add pep to all the numbers. The lyrics too compliment the songs and the theme of the movie. The legend in Vairamuthu, his novice son Kargy and Pa Vijay deserve applause.  Come to master of the ship – Shankar. The man of many achievements, who brought grandeur to Tamil cinema, has lived up to his reputation. His dream project which eventually hit the screens is nothing short of fun, frolic and excitement. Known for handling mass themes with much ease, here he combines such elements with science. A theme never heard before in Indian cinema, Enthiran, is nothing but a milestone movie. Shankar has added one more jewel in his crown."

        "review": "Enthiran movie is going to make history in the Indian Cinema. The south Indian superstar once again gonna rock in the Indian theaters as well as in the foreign theaters where superstars fans assemble to witness his extraordinary acting with his attractive style. The ace director Shankar has did his best to make his wild imaginations to come into reality by using his technicians and the Stan Winston studio in US which no other Indian film has made its entry into it. Superstar Rajinikanth is in the negative role again after decades which is going to entertain and fulfill the hype and expectation to all his die hard fans around the globe Aish, Oscar winner AR Rahman have given the best to ensure this movie to make history. The action sequence in the movie is going to keep the audience at the tip of their seats till the end of the movie. Sit relaxed and enjoy the movie!!! Wishing the Superstar and his unit a grand success by making the first Indian Sci-fi movie to compete with the Hollywood blockbusters."

        "title": "Rajini...the one and the only SUPERSTAR",
        "review": "Can you always get the best results with the best ingredients? The answer is YES, YOU CAN. Provided you have an actor/superstar who listens to his director, an actress/global celebrity who just glows on screen throughout the movie and if the big budget is totally justified.  All the credit for this extravagant movie goes to Shankar Shanmugam. The man is an absolute genius. His creativity reaches great heights with this movie and elevates the Indian movie standard to an all time high. With every movie of his, the scale of movie-making grows tremendously. He got the best technology money can buy. Looks like the majority of the budget is spent on Animatronics and this movie has got plenty of that.  Rajinikanth is magnificent in this movie. In fact, he is the movie. He adds life to every single frame created by Shankar. Aishwarya does what she does best, look GORGEOUS.She has some pretty slick dance moves in the songs.  The Animatronics are the best you could find in any movie so far and not just an Indian movie. The songs are spectacular. Shankar shows the audience some of the best places in the world all for a few bucks. The locations are mind-blowing and totally unique to this movie. Shankar handpicked the locations for the songs and they are shot on a grand scale. The music is haunting and highly entertaining.  This movie will surely become one of the biggest movies ever made in India and without a doubt bring in a lot of moolah to the producers, distributors and the exhibitors all around the world.  Rajinikanth redefines super stardom. Truly, a legend of a man."

        "title": "Endhiran...The Greatest Blockbuster of Indian Cinema!",
        "review": "Endhiran, The Robot is definitely going to be a Biggest Blockbuster of Indian Cinema.  1. Budget is $35m, most expensive movie in Asia.  2. 2250 prints, 3000 screens, largest worldwide screening after 'Spiderman'.1400 screens in Tamil Nadu alone including 48 out of 52 screens in Chennai.  3.In three language versions, Tamil,Telugu & Hindi.  4. The special effects are as good as Hollywood movies like Terminator, Matrix, Godzilla which is composed of 1500 graphical shots.  5. Double Academy Award Winner AR Rahman has scored the music.  This is a story of android based humanoid named Chitti.The first part in Endhiran movie has lot of surprises and rest half has actions and rides.  In Endhiran, Rajni plays double role. One is a scientist and another is a Robot. Scientist Rajni creates a Robot with artificial intelligence like that of sixth sense in humans to help human beings and to the development of the country.But its silicon heart falls in love with Aishwarya Rai. Writes romantic poems and the Robot behave just like a human being. Knowing about the extra ordinary intelligence of the Robot the villains try to get control of the Robot.  The last 30 minutes of the film are literally the grandmaster of all make-believe and end up creating a whole new genre of cinema: the 'curry eastern' which stands up as a wholesome alternative to the curry western. For Rajnikanth fans, the climax is definitely a sure-fire way to lose your sanity.  For non-Rajnikanth fans, it's a sure-fire way to understand the mystique and magical allure of Rajni sir, a hero who enjoys a demi-god status in several parts of India. Why? Because there are almost a hundred Rajnikanths eating up helicopters, smashing cars, battering planet earth and creating havoc, like never before. If you thought Terminator, Matrix, Godzilla was fun, then we guarantee you'll fall off your chair with glee as our desi T2-meets-Blade Runner-meets Neo-meets-Godzilla sets the screen on fire in a crazy, vengeance bid. Spoofy, yes. But super fun too.  Robot is primarily designed as an unadulterated tribute to the charisma of Indian cinema's ageless superstar, Rajnikanth. And it's completely, wholeheartedly, joyously desi. Where else would you find a hero who literally shoots with his fingers! What's more important is the fact that you actually don't mind when the bullet whizzes out of his forefinger and hits the man in front in the head. Instant death! Ha Ha!  The high point of Robot are the super quality special effects. All the Spiderman, Batman and Superhero antics of Rajnikanth have been done with exquisite elan by the Stan Winston Studio which reportedly provided the animatrics for films like Jurassic Park and Avatar. And all the stunts have been choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping, the Hong Kong based action director who created the high-adrenalin stunts of classics like Kill Bill and Matrix. Almost 40 per cent of the film's colossal budget (Rs 160 crores) has been spent on special effects, which, at the end of the day, seems all worthwhile. For watching Rajnikanth running horizontal on a speeding train, clambering across burning buildings like Spiderman or mutating into gargantuan monsters does manage to shock and awe the viewer who's out there to have big time fun.  But Robot isn't effect alone. It has a plot too which, if you really pay attention, has a meaning and a message. The film carries forward the man-machine war through interesting twists and turns and creates a lively love triangle between scientist Rajnikanth, medico student Aishwarya Rai and robot Rajnikanth. Interestingly, the duo make an interesting pair, what with Rajni sir's sundry wigs and sideburns and Aishwarya's tribal 'Kilimanjaro-Mohenjodaro' attire. You might just overdose on the pungent masala fare. Have a blast.  For Tamil audience, this movie is a definite 10 out of 10!"

        "title": "Its Rajni at his best.",
        "review": "Amazing, extravagant, intelligent, beautifully conceived- executed treat for all fans of Rajni and people who understand and enjoy the Indian masala movie!!!! Shankar has hit the jackpot, the mother lode this time with this stunning film which is going to open huge vistas for Indian cinema. Rajni is the soul of the film and my god he delivers and HOW!!! The last 45 minutes are simply cracking for his enactment of the anti hero as only he can and does.  My only regret in the film was that they seemed to have required not 200 but 400 crores to really deliver in the stunt sequences in the 2nd half! But even still, magnificent achievement with an absorbing story line which keeps you engaged and rollicking in your seats till the last frame. Aishwarya seems to get more attractive with each passing year! This is the only event (Rajni) apart from cricket in India where absolute strangers on the road, in the theatre ask each other questions on how the movie was and talk like long lost friends on any subject under the sun."

        "review": "I just came out from seeing the first day first show....Endhiran at Kasi theater in chennai. The movie started early morning at 4:30. Never seen a huge crowd like this ever before in chennai for a movie, that too early before even sunrise. The movie is 100% adrenalin rush action with Rajini's and Aiswarya's stunning performance. The graphic sequences are awesome. Its very difficult to distinguish graphics from reality. Last 1hr of the movie reminds us of 'the matrix'. The songs are picturised in a spectacular way. The movie is a super-hit in all possible angles. See it before others do. I mean to say watch it to believe my words."

        "review": "Rajini Kanth  Magic: Whats Magic? Its a Power to make you sit and watch a Person is doing and here it is... Its Sheer magic of Rajini. He had given us a Completely new Indian film. This Movie will prove in all ways, who is the super star of India.  Endhrian Movie Review  You would have heard about Western Style, Western Movie etc.. Now, here after there is one more, That is Eastern, its Eastern Style, the RAJINI Style. Rajini and Shankar will always be remembered as the Persons responsible for making a movie that will literally reduce the gap between Hollywood and Indian Movies. They are responsible for the Giant Step Tamil Film Industry had taken.  Endhiran is Indian and is Desi meets western and let we call the new genre of film making as Eastern.  The Highlight of the Endhrian is its Special Effects, that you can match this movie with any Hollywood movies. Yes this movie is - perhaps the first Indian Science Fiction movie which is successful and high in Special EFX. Here all Spidar Man, Hancock, Hulk, Superman become one man and its amazing that for the first time we are going to accept an Indian Desi Hancock. Its hard to identify Special Efx used in most of the Scenes. The Special Efx in the last 45 Minutes is breath taking and very creative, not taken or inspired from any Hollywood movies like Blade or I Robot or Spider Man or Hancock. He had introduced a new Genre and which is going to be repeated in the future, this movie is going to inspire many and many Future Indian film Directors.  The Movie is Big, Grand and Explosive. Final 15 or 20 Minutes will keep you at the edge of your seat. You will witness the greatest ever SP EFX Indian Movie or even Asian movie.  Dialogues: Dialoges are very good and easy to understand for anybody. Its simple and convey the message easily. Eg:  Person 1: Do God Exist? Chitti: What you mean by GOD? Person 1: Our Creator. Chitti: Then, Yes, (Pointing Vaseegaran) he is my God, my Creator.  On the whole: The Movie is going to break all kind of Indian Box Office records. The movie has everything, whatever the Team had promised before. Great achievement by SUN Pictures and S Shankar.  Look out for the Final 20 Minutes, the Magnetic EFX, the Giant ROBO, The Snake, Rajini's Dialoges and his Face expressions in the last quarter.  This movie is not a Masterpiece but is Path Breaking with its breath Taking Visuals. The film is a Visual Treat and technically way ahead of any Indian Movies."

        "review": "The movie starts without the usual powerful entry sequence that Superstar Rajini gets. Highly unusual but there's a first thing for everything. A nice sci-fi food for the Tamil audience. Haven't really seen this kind of a story in any of the movies so far. Nice screenplay. Stunts were a bit too much, as-usual, but not ridiculous at the same time.  Though the storyline is in sync with that of I-Robot at times, there seems to be lot of original touch to it. Absolutely lovable songs. The graphics are very decent and the work in climax scenes are damn good. Worth a watch !! Even twice. Even thrice."

        "review": "When was the last time, you watched a movie and came out of a theatre and then continued to talk about that movie for ages to come? If you have an answer, you have another opportunity and if you don't, you have your first 'experience' here!  If you are that die hard fan of Rajnikanth, you wouldn't need a review but you'd still want that loads of lines praising heaps on the Superstar! But here, you'll regret one thing – the invention of the dictionary! You won't really find one word to describe the true charisma and the on-screen persona of Rajnikanth, the undisputed Superstar of Tamil, oops Indian cinema!  The Gist of the Story:  Rajnikanth is a scientist, Vaseegaran who develops his brainchild, a robot. Names it 'Chitty' and teaches every single thing that this universe can hold. 'Chitty' is programmed to learn and know everything except for human emotions and when that is taught, how would you expect a machine to react? Watch 'Endhiran' to know how!  Dialogues:  The Superstar's fan following ranges from the villages to international cities and this being a movie talking about technology, one would expect totally technical jargon in place. But that's only a myth, because the dialogues in 'Endhiran' are simple and convey the message quite crisply making sure all the sections of the audience understand every aspect of technology and science. Now did that sound serious? The movie is neatly infused with comedy dialogues that will make you giggle and when rendered by Rajni himself, you'll just scream laughing!  Visual Effects and Editing:  The teasers and trailers stimulated the curiosity thanks to the splendid visual effects by international technicians. Examples of the dynamic effects are a plenty to talk about in the movie but sample this – a robot with unimaginable powers confronts goons with his electromagnetic property and attracts their weapons, and voila, you get to see, a spectacular scene that probably idolizes Goddess Kali! You'll have to watch it to understand and realise, it is verbally impossible to describe that scene and many other visual effects! Editing by Antony is crisp. Had the length been a little longer, the party would have been a little annoying!  Stunts:  Not just for visual effects, Shankar has also used the services of international expertise for the stunts in his movie. Yuen Woo Ping, who worked on 'The Matrix', etc, has designed stunt scenes that will make your jaws drop! Our very own Peter Heines has also done his part. A sample to tease your curiosity – an intense car chasing scene with our Superstar making a 'donut' in his Mercedes Convertible! Exhilarating!  Music:  AR Rahman, the Mozart of Madras, we've seen the response for the music right after the launch! But on screen, 'Kadhal Annukal' and 'Kilimanjaro', not to forget 'Arima', they take you by storm. The background score's decent and tries to receive your attention effectively! The rerecording in the movie is near perfect and sound capture by Oscar winner Resul Pookutty is A1.  The Cast:  Your eyes are predominantly set on the Superstar but pave way for the other leads. We'll come to the beautiful Aishwarya in a little while but before that it is going to be the gracious Danny Denzongpa, the wily villain of the movie. He is old but he is got grace and is a refreshing change from the usual villains. He adds a lot of freshness to the script, a brilliant choice of casting.  The next, comedians Karunaas and Santhanam, though they don't quite have lengthy screen presence, they still manage to receive appreciation for their comic timing. Santhanam will be a proud man to have shared screen with the superstar.  Aishwarya Rai – The Miss World, is amazing and truly an epitome of beauty! She forms an important part of the script and hence you'll spot her throughout the movie, perhaps for the first time a heroine is receiving considerable importance in a superstar's movie! The marvellous costumes add to her allure and she's just majestic in few scenes!  Rajnikanth aka Superstar:  Saving the best (or the ultimate) for the last, Rajnikanth is one man who will not cease to amaze you! If your 6 or 60, doesn't really matter because you will be in awe of the man! you will be in awe of the man! In a movie which shows signs of visual effects riding in the driver's seat, the Superstar dominates every bit to walk away with appreciation! No favouritism here, you just can't stop talking about him, once you come out! As the scientist Vaseegaran, he plays his part uncharacteristically Rajni without Punch dialogues or fights but as 'Chitty – the Robot' you are bound to follow or even turn an addict!  Sample this – as a gentle Robot he is precise in acting and when it comes to the evil side, the incredible Rajni has made sure he doesn't waste his opportunity! His evil laugh, his characteristic slick walk, that body language and the dialogue delivery in 'Endhiran' remind you of the golden Rajni time! Look out for the amazing dance moves by the superstar, given his age, a few moves are stunning, credits to the choreographers!  My Verdict:  The festival of lights, 'Deepavali' is round the corner and with the release of 'Endhiran', the fireworks have already started! Quoting the Superstar himself, 'Endhiran' for the Indian audience all around the world is an 'experience'! Don't miss it!"

        "title": "Lips like Zebra!!",
        "review": "With all the hype around the movie Endhiran (the Tax exempt version of Robot), I finally watched it in a theater in US after the theater decided to drop the priceMind you, it was still more expensive than watching Avatar, the 3D version The theater was really small unlike what the name implied, maybe I shouldn't read into things too much  I don't expect anything less from a Shankar Movie than a Top notch entertainer (Top notch by any Tamil movie standard) Without a question, he delivers againBut, the hype was that the movie is up to the international standards! And that's where I felt cheated and disappointed!  From the beginning of the movie, somehow questions started popping up in my mind May be the popcorn that I was munching had something to do with it.  Why would an accomplished Robotics scientist hire couple of Incompetent Ignorant assistants to such a high caliber job?  Am I crazy to think that the Scientist is a criminal as he runs away from the crime scene as his Robot causes a bloody injury? And the whole theater laughed at this scene! May be I'm crazy! Or, maybe it is OK because the injured is just a low level traffic cop as it is OK not to serve even coffee to the assistant as he is only a third level employee  Why would an incredibly talented Scientist, so callously smash a Robot and carelessly dump it in a dumpster Didn't he know that the Robot had the capability to casually reassemble itself?  Also, Isn't an incredible waste of a valuable resource to expect a Robot to tie it's \"Master's\" shoelace when it has mastered to calculate a prime number that would take years for a human to calculate? \"Master of all trades, but a slave for its Master\" This could be an apt subtitle for the movie..  How is it when a group of thugs try to molest a girl in a running train for so long and only a Robot is there to save, while, when the Robot kidnaps the girl, there is an army of cops available right away with Machine Guns (I mean Machine Guns!) and 20cc mopeds to save her?!  You might say, I'm misreading comedy elements as movie/character flaws..  Well, If I really wanted to watch a senseless comedy, I would rather watch Adam Sandler's \"Waterboy\" or the second half of Shahrukh Khan's \"My Name is Khan\"  I kept wondering, Why is such a talented (I'm not sarcastic here) director, Shankar, who is talented enough to transition a Robot into a human inconspicuously is complacent enough to transition from a scene to a song so abruptly.  Anyway, as a born Indian, Should I take pride in the technical accomplishments of this movie? The last I heard was that the technical work was done by the Hollywood professionals Oh! May be I just should take pride (I'm sarcastic here) in our ability to buy the technical talent from the US and call it our own achievement!  As always in a Shankar Movie, the songs were pretty good (lyrics and music) and were picturized nicely But, I wasn't really there to watch a nice music album rather I was there to witness a coming of age movie!  I might sound nitpicking on a wonderfully made movie.. May be it is wonderful in its own way  Yes, it is an entertainer But, don't expect this to be the cultural crossover movie to be recognized by the entire world! It is not! I hope they don't expect to promote to the world media that way! It will be a disservice to the Tamil talents like ManiRatnam, ARRahman and.. Well, I can't think of anyone else  For those in India, don't be hoodwinked by all the hoopla about this movie being greatly successful in US It is relatively successful only because the First Generation Indians like me (believe me, there are thousands of them) are flocking to the theaters where they don't mind sharing their seats (with the bedbugs) and sparing their hygiene It'll be more accurate if I put \"only\" again after \"because\" in the above statement  If you can get anyone else (anyone other than the first generation Indians) not to walkout within the first 15 minutes of this movie, then you may have to carry him/her in a stretcher after the movie or during the interval whichever fits you  BTW, hats off to the poet who compared beautiful lips of Aishwarya to zebra I guess her teeth are zebra crossings then"

        "review": "With a bevy of machine guns in hand; all triggers locked, Superstar delivers a resounding punch line; 'Happy Diwali folks'. Yes, it was Diwali, minutes before the start of the first show here in Chennai with crackers going off in thousands, flowers flying around and people going delirious with excitement. This is Diwali; no matter even if  the real one is still a month away, Superstar has arrived!  Overall, Endhiran is a 'robotic, hypnotic, supersonic, Superstar' experience, the first of its kind in Tamil cinema and the only one of its kind for a long time to come. It is going to take a Herculean effort to equal or better Endhiran within the confines of Tamil cinema. Let's hope the day comes soon. For now, an ovation to the Endhiran team, Sun Pictures and Kalanithi Maran for showing faith in Shankar's vision and to Hansraj Saxena for masterful execution of the project. If not for the faith, confidence and vision of these men, Shankar's ten year dream would still have been just a dream.  Do Indian cinema a favour, watch Endhiran; let a 100 other Shankars feel bold enough to dream.  Verdict: Indian cinema's pinnacle of evolution – 'Robot sapiens"

My rating : 10/10 as a Rajni fan My rating : 9/10 as one of the public  What a making ? What a work ? Brilliant . Enjoyed each & every seconds.  I already booked tickets for few more upcoming shows.  Above we received some negative comments from few writers. Please don't consider those comments. A 175c Shankar's team can give these much of output, then with the budget of Avatar, Shankar can give a much better 'Tamil' movie than 'Avatar' . This is true - believe  The price of the ticket is in the riveting climax involving thousands of Robo Rajinis joining forces to have their day as part of society. Overall the movie is a must watch Indian movie of 2010 and is an excellent showcase of Indian cinema and what it can bring to an industry that churns out more absurd masal every year than an audience can stomach. Overall 9/10"

        "review": "First of all the film is mind blowing for an Indian movie standard. Shankar has compromised himself in the screenplay just to ensure that this movie reach the common Indian audience. For those audience who don't understand the basics of computers and robotics, this movie is going to be a magic - A Super hero subject. For those fans who have a bit of knowledge in computers, this movie would make them wonder about the robotics technology, though this is a fiction.  The first half is fully entertaining with lots of comedy. The second half of the second half is filled with excellent CGs and Rajni's tremendous action. The first half of the second half is where the movie is a bit boring containing lots of unwanted scenes.  Second half of the second half is excellent. Nobody would have ever expected such a turning point. The scenes are very thrilling.  Songs are just inserted in the movie just for commercial purpose. This movie would have been more better if there are no songs.  Photography, stunts are far more excellent for an Indian movie. This movie will be a trend setter for bringing CG related movies in future to India. Though this movie is not up to Hollywood standard and cannot be compared to Hollywood, this is the first step that an Indian movie has taken in that direction.  Hats off Shankar and Team. Thanks to Kalanithi Maran for making this possible! None other than him could have given such a movie at this time!"

        "review": "Endhiran roughly translates to \"The Robot\" and what you get in this Bollywood adventure is a big smashing together of nearly every trope ever associated to robotic androids in movies.  The story follows an Indian scientist who has created a robotic replication of himself. The robot named Chitti is designed to be a super soldier for the Indian government, but when Chitti starts to feel human emotion and courts the scientist's girlfriend, things begin to go awry.  The movie is part action, part drama, part comedy, part romance, part musical, etc. It is a lot of things, and like many Bollywood movies, it doesn't seem to work that well in the transitions. Really, the movie does try to deal with the heavy concept of human emotions and the dangers of them, but these odd transitions between different styles do not aid in accentuating this theme. For example, whenever the characters feel a rush of emotion they burst into song-and-dance to techno glory, but these scenes, much like the action scenes and the infamous mosquito scene (which was ridiculous and just plain weird, where Chitti converses with a pack of mosquitos), they all drag on for far too long, as if the filmmakers could not distill down the scenes to a reasonable length. And speaking of the bizarre, the change in the middle of the movie where Chitti goes from being the good guy to being the bad guy just makes little to no sense, and it feels as if there are two movies here rather than one. Focus on finishing one story before gearing up another.  Endhiran may appeal to fans of Bollywood, but to us others it leaves us scratching our heads after this visually stimulating, but unfulfilling ride of human emotion.  I give Endhiran a 2 out of 10!"

Shankar best ever - its not the hype that revolves him its the talent prodigy that keeps him going...  Rajni - Thalaivar at his best even at this age.. Nobody at this age would have done this much justice to the character Aishwarya - no wonder she was miss world AR rahman - Oscar is a mere starter for him.  Overall this movie has created history among indians and hard core rajni fans."

It is entertaining watching Rajnikanth between screaming Rajni fans on First day. Rajnikanth performs with his usual charm & essence to give Indian Cinema a real Hero & a legendary Villain in this Movie .The Visual effects in the First Half was Pathetic ,But as a remedy we will watch spectacular visual effects spilling in front of eyes in the Second Half .  Script is Concentrated in a Cyborg with Programmed Emotions falling in Love with his Scientist's Niece & Gradually trapped in Wrong hands yet Re Programmed as a Destruction Tool .  The Enthiran is a Total Commercial Entertainer for Rajni Fans & Just a Time pass Movie for World Viewers .  This will be the Downfall of Bollywood in Indian Movie Industry . Tamil Industry is gaining some Levels & Standards .  Ps :- There is only one Superstar in Entire World , Rajnikanth"

        "review": "The day was finally set. I was going to watch \"Endhiran\", the most expensive Indian movie ever made. The \"Avatar\" of India, the posters claimed. I will admit upfront, I am not a huge fan of either Shankar or Rajinikanth, but there was a glimmer of hope as it was a screenplay by the late Sujatha, a true technocrat whose books and prose I have cherished over the years (would he have coined the term \"Robo Sapiens\"?). As Sujatha had passed away during the pre-production of the movie, I was well aware that the screenplay would have been completed by Shankar (Madhan Karky is also credited as a co-script writer). The initial reviews had lauded the movie claiming it to be a benchmark in Indian cinema and how Indian cinema has improved by leaps and bounds and how the movie will stand up to any Hollywood production of recent years.  The movie proved be a huge disappointment (except a few scenes) and it also proved the fact that without a cohesive screenplay, any movie, even the most expensive one, would turn out to be a fiasco and dishearten the non-emotionally-invested viewers. Let's face it; the movie would have never worked with that screenplay, without a huge-name star to portray the protagonist, the innocent robot Chitti (Speed 1 THz, Memory 1 Zettabyte) and the antagonist (Chitti v.2.0). Rajini, a force/star he may be, but it is the actor that I miss, whom I last saw in \"Thalapathy\" (1991). I was subject to over-the-top performances and over-the-top everything that I have come to witness in Shankar movies. Aishwarya Rai, as Sana, is beautiful (as always) but has little else to do, as others, who just appear in the scenes without leaving a mark. It is understandable that Shankar wanted Rajini to carry the movie, but I was used to the Rajini that I saw on-screen; he did not bring anything new to this movie. I was comforted in the fact, that there were no build-ups to the Dr. Vaseegaran character and no opening songs claiming the protagonist to be the all conquering singing, dancing hero of the silver screen.  The songs, good as they were, only managed to drag the flow (if there was any) of the already stumbling screenplay and the second half seemed to drag. I believe it is now time for Thamizh movies (or any movies, except musicals) to not have song sequences which just test our patience as I did not gain anything from a song set in Machu Picchu as Dr. Vaseegaran was contemplating the future of Chitti. Plot holes galore in this movie which took two years to complete; we are shown that as Sana is kidnapped by Chitti v.2.0, the police randomly firing at the car; were they not worried that Sana might be killed in the cross-fire or were they all crack-shots? And, did we need to see Chitti conversing with mosquitoes? I felt angry for spending the money and wasting my time watching this utter garbage, which some of my friends have claimed to be the best Thamizh film ever! Shankar has taken elements from \"Bicentennial Man\" and \"I, Robot\" and served up a diarrhea inducing meal on a silver platter. It was really hard to believe that Santhanam and Karunas to be scientists, but even that seemed tolerable compared to the \"romantic\" scene between Aishwarya and Rajini (Sana wants to end their relationship) where Vaseegaran asks Sana to return the kisses he had given during the course of their relationship. The scene takes us to a very artificial looking desert as Rajini plays the guitar (if you can believe his strumming - looked more like he was moving his hands up and down the guitar) and a beautiful song wasted in \"Kadhal Anukkal\".  The one scene that I found really impressive, was the Chitti (v.2.0) metamorphosing fight sequence in the climax, supported by the background score with the metallic edge as provided by Academy Award winner A. R. Rahman. I expected more from Chitti (v.2.0); Rajini should have explored more with what makes Chitti (v.2.0) tick, but, as he said in the Endhiran audio launch, he had followed Shankar's directions to a T, which, in my opinion has backfired as Chitti (v.2.0) exaggerates its' speech and gestures as the much-detested Shankarism comes into play in the third act. I did not empathize with Chitti as it dismantled itself; I found it neither moving nor the fitting end to the most expensive movie of Indian cinema. My absolute anger lies in the fact that this so-called-excuse for a movie was marketed as a challenge to Hollywood productions and the announcement of Thamizh cinema on to the world stage. If the rest of the world considers \"Endhiran\" as a token Thamizh movie, I will be among the first to completely switch off Thamizh movies and deny that I ever watched them. Dot."

        "review": "I happened to see Robot (Hindi Version) a few days back. Believe me, I am ashamed to even commit to my friends that I saw this crap. The Movie is silly from the beginning and never delivers anything intelligent, which is expected from a science fiction. I feel sorry for Rajnikanth who has compromised so much, just to please his fan base. It is difficult to believe that he is the same person who stared in the movie-Thalpathi (Mani Ratnam).  Coming back to Robot. My question for Mr.Shankar is when he is going to give us an intelligent and a smart film. I have no complains with the special effects, they were very well executed and were of Hollywood standards. Specially the final ten minutes.  However, there was nothing like a story in the movie. It was predictable from the first scene and was longer than required and top of it, there were just too much songs. Songs were poor and lyrics were just pathetic. The twists were stupid and did not fit in with theme of the movie.  In terms of acting, Rajni is acceptable as the scientist and unbearable as the Robot. Mrs.Bachaan, it seems is signing everything coming at her hand these days, so no complains from her, because we all know what she is capable off. Mr.Danny, I understand you have no work these days, so you are pardoned for being a part of this foolish, dramatic and shameless movie.  It is these movies which draws the Indian Film industry backwards. I pity the people who consider this as entertainment and spend thousand of rupees in watching this crap. Stay away, support good films."

        "review": "To start off with , im a fan of both rajini n shankar. My expectations for the movie were extremely high going on the points that this was the most expensive Asian movie ever made. With shankar, rajini, ar rahman, i expected nothing short of a magical entertaining movie.  The shock i got when i got to the cinemas to watch this movie was unexplainable. Story wasn't good, music disaster, graphics: maybe the best they could do in kollywood but not worth the money they spent. Rather they spent the money on the songs, they could have spent on polishing the graphics or brushing off the obvious blunders.  Well all i can say is the movie 'could' appeal to local fans in India who haven't really seen sci-fi movies before, but internationally its a disgrace to tamil cinema.  The only positive is, its the first of its kind in tamil cinema, the first stepping stone for the industry into this genre, and i hope they learn from their mistakes.  One thing is for sure, Indian cinema will never reach the heights of Hollywood."

        "review": "The biggest movie of Asia is finally here and whoa ! its mind blowing. Endhiran the robot is the costliest Indian film to date and it has lived up to all its hype and expectations from all over the world. Superstar Rajnikanth is a household name all over India for his style and punch dialogs but this movie propels him to the big Hollywood league. There are plenty of times where we see Hollywood movies like the matrix, avatar or inception and feel why doesn't Indian filmmakers imagine like that.. the answer has been given by Shankar who has relieved his ten year dream to produce one of the greatest Indian sci-fi movies of all time.. to be honest the graphics is in the movie is not Hollywood standard but as close as it can get..  The story is an ordinary love triangle between the lead characters but what is extraordinary is its execution. Shankar is the first one to bring the Hollywood standard storyboard before shooting method to Tamil cinema and his hard work is clearly visible in each and every frame of the movie.. The stunt choreography is top notch and a particularly long climax sequence is \"the\" best sequence ever shot in an Indian movie. There is a license which Rajni gets as a part of his massive fan following all over south India - the Demi-God status.. he can do whatever he wants to do even if it defies logic but in Endhiran he has gone over the limit of imagination delivering awesome acting and top notch commitment. The movie drags slightly in the second half but the screenplay as a whole and climax sequence in particular made my day !"

        "title": "So disappointed! (major spoilers)",
        "review": "So much was expected and so little was delivered. Although I am not a big fan of this type of film, I absolutely loved The Terminator and Alien. Unlike these two films, Endhiran failed to involve me emotionally with any of the characters; in the end, I didn't care who lived or died.  It was also hard to digest the pairing of Aishwarya and Rajnikanth. I cringed every time they touched. In all of India, could they not find a younger actor to play this role? And did the character of Sana really need to be a college student? Additionally, the movie was excruciatingly long. Was the mosquito scene really needed? And the scene where the robot helps a woman in delivering her baby looked so fake that I was embarrassed for the director; if it can't be well done, then why bother doing it? This did not really add anything to the story. Also, the climax went on and on and on and on and on and on. I mean, get it over already! I know a lot of people love this kind of action, but enough is enough.  The script was illogical in parts. When Dr. Vasigaran decides to do away with Chitthi, he cuts him up in pieces, then throws it in the trash. Should he not have removed a computer chip or something? Is this not how he dismantles the bad robot in the end? And how did the robot end up in the bad scientist's car? When did he have time to create so many replicas of himself? It seemed to take Dr. Vasigaran forever to create just one.  And now for the music. I suppose that the songs were suitable for this type of movie but I did not find one memorable song in the bunch. I mean this is A.R. Rahman we're talking about! I also thought that the transition to the songs were so badly done, it was almost like a jolt to the system. As for Aishwarya's dancing, that was the only thing that I enjoyed in the whole movie. It has been a long time since she has done so much dancing and she is so good at this. I must say however that I much prefer it when she dances a traditional Indian dance than this modern stuff.  So, all in all, 2 out of 10 for Aishwarya's dancing!"

Performance - RAJNI sir was AWESOME...THALAIVAAAAA!....Aishwarya was gorgeous..she plays a college student...and she's gives Katrina a run for all her money....Danny isn't really the antagonist...he has a small but important role and he does it very well.....Santhanam & Karunas pull of the funny bone perfectly with Rajni Sir. 2. Music ----- Hahaha! AR Rahman...the name is enough.......The music is simply mind blowing! 3. Cinematography --- Brilliant....usually it's just the songs...but here, the entire movie has been shot brilliantly... 4. Special Effects --- THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE...except for the baby birth scene...everything else was perfect.....the best ever in an Asia! The climax fight sequence was brilliant...and so is the initial fight scene with the local Goondas..... 5. Action---- AMAZING!..no match...MATCHE ILLA! 6. Story --- Funny first half...as you keep laughing every other second......while the second half is quite serious as the Villain is revealed......overall.....the story is GOOD vs EVIL and Good prevails in the end type....but nevertheless, it's entertaining. In short, everything is perfect. There is no overdose of anything. Performances by everyone is apt! The music is brilliant, the songs and scenes are perfect, the story and the EXTRA ORDINARY action fits perfectly in the plot! It's an out an out entertainer, nothing of the sort can be seen in Bollywood, it's pure Kollywood style....with a Hollywood touch.......South Indian Sambhar in Western sausage!  MY VERDICT - It's an ultimate entertainer....****1/5"

        "review": "Caught the first show here in bangalore. First of all, hats off to the director for pulling off something this big in Indian cinema. The so called story revolves only around Rajini the scientist, robo and rai. Even the villain does not have a big part to play. Rajinikanth as we know is missing, this is Shankar's \"Rajini\". The first 30 min are pure fun, then the story comes in and from then on it depends weather the individual is a rajini fan or not to enjoy the film!! Sci-fi takes a serious hit. But when it comes to Rajinikanth sci-fi,logic,physics,math everything should take a hit. So if that does not concern you and if you are a major Rajini fan like me, this movie is for you, to see hundreds of rajini at the same time and rai romancing rajini, it happens only once and this is your chance !! Sci-fi fans may rate the movie 1/10, but who cares when you have rajini on the screen.  7/10."

        "review": "This movie has once again shown that Tamil industry is going nowhere. I mean come on, I expected a lot from this movie. But once again lot of marketing strategy marred the movie. I have been a fan of Kamal and Rajini (almost all of Balachander's) for a long time. Rajini has sure got talent but I cant stand it anymore of it being completely misused.  Aishwarya Rai in this movie is just being used to show up and for songs(the glamor factor). Of late almost all of tamil movies does it. They have no roles for Heroine. They base their movies solely on Hero and what more they add more spicy stuff to the movie.  As famous Vivek Dialogue goes \"We even make Jackie Chan to speak Madras Tamil\". Now we made, what should be a serious, breathtaking, feverish movie into a masala mix. Unless we stop bringing stuff into a movie just because of the external pressure to do so, Tamil Industry is gonna struggle. Probably most people would understand it's about the songs. This movie doesn't warrant the kind of songs it has.  Neither Shivaji nor Endhiran were Shankar-isque or Rajini-isque movies. Just like Kamal did in Dasavatharam, these two have made a mistake of allowing the character to compensate the plot. Hope my two greats Rajini and Legendary Kamal come back to their own."

This Shankar directed marvel tells you one thing.If you are up against Rajni, you should be Rajni !! It contains so many Rajnis to blow your mind away. This, the most expensive Indian motion picture till date, provides you with everything u can expect from a film and leaves you speechless with its graphics, dialogs, action sequences and everything. Rajni is at his brilliant best, Shankar at his directing best and you'll definitely know from this movie why aishwarya rai is the most beautiful women alive !! The songs are brilliantly picturized, cinematography is very very good and every scene is a visual feast, especially the first song and the Kilimanjaro Song. The technical values are by far the best any Indian movie has had. The comedy is rib tickling. The only downside is the narrative which slows down as the movie proceeds into the second half and regains pace as the movie nears the end. There are too many songs in the second half as well. Rajni shows his age (60 and still running). On the whole a must watch 8/10"

This is in the line of trash movies coming out of so called Bollywood-like-\"Three Idiots\" and \"Dabaang\". The problem is these kind of movies appeals to the masses who have no taste or their threshold of entertainment has been irrevocably lowered by by the imbecile and cheap non-Indian actors like Aamir Khan and Salman Khan. Any six year old can come with this concept of a robot which can do math quiz (I would have been more impressed if the Robot could have made Sana (Ash Rai) act. She remains just an eye candy and an acting-dancing robot after 120'odd films. I am yet to see an hint of acting.I think this movie's popularity is another example of the despair and decadence of the Hindi Films to the point of no return. Crores spent on special effects-on foreign talent, is a collossal waste of money with no benefit to the locals who are starving for food and enployment."

        "review": "I went with no expectations because I know Rajinikanth flicks tend to over the top and little hard to believe. His previous one 'Sivaji' was little too long but genuinely made me laugh and had a powerful message.  This one is just a 'Been There Done That' but now with Expensive CGI. Only this time, with the premise of a Artificial Intelligence, the gags have got even more unbelievable. You'll might end up getting a little headache at the end because it is REALLY long and drags.  The male lead is played well as you would expect, especially in his negative avatar but the dialogue is pretty ordinary, so he loses his charm a bit. But he did do his best, trying to bring out the conflict of a android living among humans, learning to deal with feelings, but the director kept that to a limited and concentrated more on a Bang Bang Boom flick. I guess he should start picking up slower roles, more in line with his age where his acting skills can be better appreciated.  The lead actress is just a sad waste of space. Nothing more can be said. She doesn't looks like she belongs anywhere, and the script makes it worse.a shame considering the amount they paid her. Barring these two, the rest of the cast is not integral to the story.  In between, I guarantee you'll laugh a bit, but that sadly is not due to any comic genius but rather mindless and impossible over the top fight scenes which honestly, has reached it's saturation point in today's world, no matter how slick you make it. The one man fighting an army of goons concept has got to go, all it does is show glorified aerobics and stunt doubles.  Attempts at genuine comedy seem out of place with confusing animated sequence's and the constant bickering of the jealous caretakers which again is just comic book gags, nothing else.  Since the CGI is the calling card of this flick, it doesn't disappoint. The latter part is a treat visually, but the the start looked little rough. This is a plus point and you'll never see a better visually stunning Indian movie.  Also, the film-makers should have gone and visited a REAL medical setup and then portrayed it as close as you can get, rather than just show a utopian paradise full of PEOPLE prancing and Macbooks. Same goes with a REAL court proceeding. Verdicts coming and going as soon as someone stands up with a view makes the judiciary look like clowns. It's not too much, and the simple things go a long way.  The timing of the songs during the movie are abrupt and the songs themselves are hopeless. This is puzzling. What is need to show luxurious scenery in the background with the lead doing a mini fashion show. If you have to do it, keep it for the credits and let the movie flow. True, the scenery was spectacular, but I think it belongs on a National Geographic special more than anything.  The directing of the film is in line with the theme, with not much to do. However at the end of the movie, where the director actually had a job to do, was poorly executed, rushed through and looked too artificial with a summary speech. The guys at South Park do it better.  Look at the animators doing their job to perfection.  In summary, if your a fan of Rajinikanth's movie's, nothing can stop you from liking it, so enjoy. It's always 10/10 for you'll.  For the rest who maybe seeing a Tamil Movie for the first time, true,it's an experience, but STAY AWAY from this one at least. This is almost a 'What if Micheal Bay tried to an Indian style Movie'. It's not worth just to go for the visuals.  Honourable Mention - Robin William's 1999's Bicentennial Man. A truly flawless performance from Robin Williams and Directer Chris Columbus about advanced android in the near future, coming to terms with his yearnings to be human, his internal conflicts with himself and the affections for his caretaker."

        "review": "With though all with the dubbing entertaining hassles in Hindi for the movie, the special effects actually made up if there is anything wrong in the movie. Rajnikanth, will surely handle it and he does best. Rajnikanth, who is actually 60 plus years old has played three different characters - the scientist Mr. Vasi, who creates the Robot, Chitti and the evil robot, Chitti again and then 1000 Chitti's in the movie. One question that arises, for which character was Rajnikanth paid and if it was for all 1000s of character, then he should be beating Warren Buffet, this year.  Wait till the end of the last action sequence that is completely original. The movie is a complete Indian Sci-fi which Indian directors are scared to make. It also raises pertinent issues in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, do we need to droids with feelings and reasoning capabilities. This movie other being huge commercial success, it should be one of the entries into Oscars in the Foreign Language category - A complete entertainer."

        "title": "Again Another garbage from director Shankar",
        "review": "First of all, i personally thank director shankar for making my guess right. Yes, i made an wild guess about this movie before its release, that this Endhiran is going to suck all the way. Million thanks to Shankar.  Before going to this movie, i expected this movie will not suit my taste. But in first few minutes of movie, i thought i had wrong opinion about Endhiran. Yes, film started with impressive note. I was about to change my mind and decided let me involve into this movie completely. But there was unnecessary inclusion of song \"kadhal Anukkal\" which completely distracted me. From thereon, movie's path marched towards typical Indian Garam masala. First half was somewhat tolerable, but second half, completely garbage and awful. Songs, mosquito scenes and overdose of CGI which completely ruined my cinema viewing experience.  It clearly shows that even though if we hire Hollywood technicians, we can't produce quality sci fi film, unless and until we have good and intelligent directors. The problem with Indian film makers is that nobody wants to experiment and change the path of Indian cinema. We just stick around with same old traditional formula like a boy meets a girl type love stories.  As far as Endhiran concern, i don't see any new, apart from that Robot character \"Chitti\". This movie contains all sort masalas poured in and they did it in the name of sci fi. That's pathetic and ridiculous. This film has half baked triangular love story and certainly i could see many action stunts have been borrowed from various Hollywood sci fi flicks. Another thing which lacks in the movie is story telling. Many directors in India fail to understand the concept of storytelling which is the main tool for any cinema. Always there should be proper presentation and execution. Shankar definitely lacks maturity in execution and presentation. Since \"boys\", his approach towards film making have been changed. He lost all his charms and started making stupid movies like \"Anniyan\", \"Sivaji\" and now \"Endhiran\"  But to me, the biggest surprise that after long time, i had opportunity to see Rajnikanth in negative role. This film became hit just because of Rajnikanth. Without his presence, this movie would have been biggest flop in Indian cinema. In fact, without Rajni no producer in our country would dare to invest Rs.200 crores. I am happy with Rajni alone, but i am disappointed with Danny Dezongpa who is suppose to be one of the finest actor in India. But his character development was not up to the mark. Aishwarya, nothing to say, she doesn't fit to be an actress. All other characters are dummy piece.  As far as music concern, ARR should have done better. BGM for this movie doesn't suit on certain scenes which i felt totally mistimed. CGI was average but not great as i expected.  Overall, this Endhiran is definitely not for die hard sci fi lovers around the world but it will be definitely good treat for die hard Rajni's fans.  1/10"

        "title": "Poor-man's version of Hollywood sci-fi staples",
        "review": "Endhiran (The Robot) is the much-touted Indian sci-fi extravaganza that debuted last year. If you've seen the trailer, you'll have a pretty good idea what you're getting into. A roboticist builds a lifelike robot and begins teaching him how to become human. The scenes practically write themselves, but they're overpowered by frequent song and dance numbers that interrupt the flow of the movie. These are mildly entertaining at first for their sheer novelty, but by the fourth number I started looking at my watch.  If not for these distractions, Endhiran would fit right in with Hollywood's blockbusters. It certainly regurgitates enough gags from them, with a particular fondness for The Matrix and Terminator films (Woo-Ping Yuen was hired to choreograph the stunts, so it's not too surprising). Naming the origins of its low-rent scenes ahead of your friends might make for an interesting drinking game, but the lack of imagination is disappointing. It does try to put its own spin on familiar ideas, but is most successful when it pits man vs machine for the love of a woman. But it takes far too long to build up to that, and the fun action sequences are fleeting.  At nearly three hours long, some cuts here and there would be appreciated. There's a disproportionate number of scenes with questionable value (ones with talking mosquitoes, and another where a woman gives birth come to mind), and they're not always entertaining for the right reasons. I wouldn't say that Endhiran is so bad that it's only worth watching just for laughs, but it comes pretty darn close.  In the end, this is a tough one to recommend due to its taxing length and general stupidity, never mind the largely unwelcome Bollywood-style numbers (Endhiran isn't considered a true Bollywood film because it was filmed in Chennai in Tamil). But the action scenes, with their cartoon physics and utter disregard for realism, are pretty hilarious. The grand finale, in which hundreds of humanoid robots band together like modular parts to form gigantic snakes, drills, and other stuff might be enough to sway this one into the \"must see\" category, if you're in the mood for something totally crazy. Just be prepared to wade through a whole lot of cheese to get there."

        "review": "Superstar Rajinikanth is back with his a new film for his fans that not just idolise him but also worship him like their God. Just when you think, what else can be new? A super entrance scene for Rajini, countless Rajini punch dialogues, and stunts with glasses and cigarettes, who wants to see those things again? Definitely not me, that is why I was super sceptical about watching Endhiran in the first place, furthermore his last film, Shivaji didn't exactly earn good reviews.  With countless positive reviews on Endhiran buzzing around, it got me curious to see how exactly can Rajini be different this time. This movie has been raved for the special effects & sci-fi content, on par with Hollywood standard. And not to mention hubby who has been losing sleep (ok, maybe that's a little aggregation, but somewhat to that effect) over catching the movie ever since the trailers were released.  How can Rajini triumph himself? By himself, of course! That is how Shankar's latest offering, Endhiran seems to have been conceived. Shankar has always shown his mastery in direction and highly imaginative song picturisation. He has always come up with the most unique special effects and amazing skills in his film song picturisations. It is high time he put his visions into a film that actually justifies the use of special effects.  The good news is, there is no lame Rajini super-entrance scene. It all starts with Dr. Vasi creating an andro humanoid (not to be confused with android), Chitti, to work with the military and help the society. Chitti is configured with the most advanced specifications and has the ability to do what human can and can't do, minus feelings. Vasi has a girlfriend, Sana, vying for his attention, so he lets his Robot spend time and help her out, eg bashing up thugs in the train, rescuing her from rape and even cheating in exam. While trying to get Chitti qualified with the Artificial Intelligence Research Department, Vasi gets influenced by his mentor Bohra, into programming feelings into Chitti, which is when the trouble begins. Like most Indian films, we have a love triangle situation, with a twist! Once Vasi realises the repercussions, he finally destroys and disposes Chitti, later falling into the wrong hands, and voila, you have the super-villain Chitti version 2.0.  Rajini has definitely outdone himself in Endhiran. He does a wimpy Dr Vasi, comedian Chitti, and villainous Chitti v2.0 (here we get to see some of Rajini's usual style, I believe infused to satisfy die-hard fans of his). And not just that, Rajini also plays the thousands of henchmen Chitti v2.0 creates by himself as his army. You also see multiples of Rajini in one song sequence, which is done nicely without looking like copy and paste of Rajini images. It is amazing the kind of acting and action Rajini can do in his 60s, a feat not many actors can stand up to.  Aishwarya, with not much acting to do, looks gorgeous throughout, and looks almost goddess-like in the songs. I like her hip-hop rapper image in 'Boom Boom Robo Da' song. She looks younger for her age, but does not look like a student, heck, if you have a 60 year old Rajini playing much younger role, why not her? She has, perhaps the best, body language and dancing skills in the industry. AR Rahman's music is just OK, but watching the film, it really grows on you.  Not much scope and attention is given to the other characters, perhaps to keep the storyline emphasized between the main characters. Most amazingly, you would feel more chemistry between Sana and Chitti than with Vasi himself.  Some unnecessary scenes and situations are added in to accommodate the chartbusting songs, which could have easily been omitted to keep the pace. The two comedian acting as lab assistants for Vasi, are avoidable, as Chitti himself provides us with plenty of laugh and light moments.  The moral of the story, andro humanoids can have all abilities, but humanity is not something to be memorised, but to be understood. The evil in humans is what creates evil and suffering in the world.  I have always believed in not comparing Indian films with Hollywood because both the industries produce movies of different genres to server their respective audience. And with Endhiran, it is the dawn of a new film genre, masala sci-fi action. It is in a category of its own with fantabulous effects and action. Watch out for the 25 minutes climax action scene, it got a non-action-lover like me gawking with out-of-the-world awesomeness! There are going to be countless film makers following this genre after this.  Finally a movie that can justify Rajini's super-human actions, and it does not disappoint. Endhiran, it is! What humans can't do, Rajini, I mean, Robot can!"

        "title": "Endhiran -The Review",
        "review": "Movie Review By: Y Sathya Kumar Rating: 7.4/10  Chiefly, I was taken away by Rajinikanth's performance in the film. The guy's charisma never gives us a chance to be unhappy with him in the screen.  The storyline is simple. The plot revolves around a Scientist(Rajini: Vaseegaran) who creates a humanoid(Rajini:Chitti) to for Military purposes and tests it by releasing it to the society to see how it fares.Ultimately,it fails approval by the scientist's rival(Danny Denzongpa) whom condemns it for the lack of feeling and knowing what's right and wrong. Vaseegaran continues his upgrading and gives Chitti emotions and feelings. Chitti thus becomes self-aware and falls in love with the scientist's lover (Aishwaraya rai : Sana). Vaseegaran disapproves Chitti's love for Aishwaraya and sends it for Military usage; Chitti however fails to impress the higher officials in the military and Vaseegaran hacks the Robot. Danny Denzongpa then picks up the hacked parts of Chitti, makes changes to it and plans to sell it to terrorist for money. However, Chitti after being modified to be evil rather chooses to pursue Aishwaraya rai and kills off Danny Denzongpa. The final scenes show Vaseegaran saving Aishwaraya rai from Chitti and changing it back to its original form.  The movie started off promising giving the audience a serious mood; however the story slowly fails to capture the same mood and goes for a more comical mood by the end of the film. This is subtle letdown as audience would have been lost with the roller coaster ride of the mood in the film, especially when Chitti turns villain, audience would be confused with the emotions and unsure as the mood wanted audiences to expect a real bad-ass Robot but rather a typical villain Rajinikanth (the actor started off his career with negative roles) character appears.  But it was not devastating for the film as the Indian audience were definitely happier to see the typical villain Rajinikanth.  A.R. Rahman who provided the score in Endhiran did a wonderful job and we heard the right things at the right moment and nothing went wrong in his department.  The cinematography needs to be applauded as it was breathtaking and colorful, giving the eyes of the viewer a holiday-like feel.  Visual effects and animatronics were the real deal in the movie. The people who made the movie a real hit would be the names you will be seeing at the ending credits starts to roll. They were the heroes of the much appreciated climax of Endhiran.  Another area for major improvement was the screenplay, since the visual effects (Industrial Light & Magic) and animatronics (Stan Winston Studios) were done by the best in the world and the director was left to his direction. He could have concentrated more on the screenplay and bought us imagery of Chitti's perspectives. I.e. The train fight scene where Chitti had to fight off a group of bad guys might have been better if Chitti was able to analyze and select his wide array of programmed fighting skills for the current situation, rather than just fighting them off with a default Kung fu fight.  The viewers could actually predict the following scenes as all were chronological and orderly; Shanker could have actually saved it from the mundane Traditional movie sequencing.  Director Shanker could have also worked more on the ending. He could have surprised the audience with a twist-ending or an opening to a possible sequel. He rather finished it off like everybody expected- a happy ending.  Other aspects of the film were very well done too. Fighting and Dancing choreographers did a excellent job overall.  I have to keep emphasizing the Indian audience as this Tamil movie is actually customized for them and is already grossing millions, the only sad thing it was so near becoming a good Sci-Fi for audiences all over the world. Nevertheless, this Sci-fi movie is new and a brave attempt by Shanker to the audiences which has all the ingredients for the whole family to enjoy.  Go for Endhiran the Robot to see Rajinikanth and a maiden attempt by Indian Cinema on Sci-Fi (Indian Style) setting a new genre...  Verdict: A blockbuster for Indian audiences and Rajini Fans... An entertaining Sci-fi movie with few flaws for other audiences..."

        "title": "Man, those trailers lied",
        "review": "My main reason for seeing this movie was the trailer, which evoked a reaction from me something similar to \"ha, what cheesy effec- HOLY ROBOT SNAKE!\" Rest assured, I had no delusions about this being a Bollywood movie, and went in fully prepared (and hoping) for dance numbers, melodrama, and a plot that would make Shyamalan cringe. What I didn't expect was that these things would all be done terribly. The dance numbers, at their best, are Black Eyed Peas music videos shot in a Windows 98 wallpaper (that's not a good thing), Aishwarya Rai's character has the emotional complexity of a poodle, and the ever-bloated Rajnikanth looks like he's about to burst at the seams of his popped-collar polo shirt. The plot could not make less sense, with random 20 minute tangents that advance no action, and the subtitles often appear to just be sounded out from the Tamil dialogue (did they think that \"monopsychotic\" is actually a word?). It's hard to articulate all of what's wrong with this movie, but let the phrase \"group of sentient, conversant CG mosquitoes\" do some of the work for me. Yeah, that happens, and it's actually a high point in the otherwise ulcer-inducing comedy. A big deal has been made over the exorbitant budget for this movie, but you wouldn't know it unless you stayed (conscious) for the last 15 minutes of this three hour movie. By some tremendous error of pacing, all the promoted action occurs then, in an ugly mish mash of special effects and car chases, while the previous 11/12ths of the movie have the production value of a Syfy special. Seriously, just watch Om Shanti Om again. At least Shahrukh Khan's got abs, and Deepika Padukone isn't half as shrill as Rai."

        "review": "You have to be prepared though. This is a movie of extremes. There is no room for subtle. And strangely it works in the movie. What I know from South Indian cinema is that they love the fantastic genre. And Endhiran has taken it to the next level. While the cgi scenes in itself can be perceived as cheesy for the most times it was used very creatively. Simply said it was fun to look at. Rajnikant shows why he is perceived as the superstar he is.He is quite amazing in his double role although he also could be very off at times. I think that is the directions fault. Overall this movie isn't meant to make you think but to to entertain. Even when some serious subjects are getting discussed here. Of course some scenes look like they are copied from movies like Terminator or I,Robot! Still,it did not bother me at all since most scenes did gave another spin to it. Thumbs up for this production!"

        "review": "If you want to make you 2 to 6 years old kids to be entertained then go with them to watch this movie. It is worst than Transformers and no way to touch any mega movies like Terminator, Robo Cop, or Avatar. The story and direction is very poor and typical South Indian type, the rape of attempt on girl and unnecessary long fight scenes. The worst thing is its special effects. But what should we say to Indians, who even liked the Krish type of movie very much. The ending special effects are so bad that I was feeling to vomit on the floor of the theater. It becomes a globe and Snake, and drill machine. So childish everything, Ha ha ha the Kind of \"Mogambo Khush Huwa\". I think the Indian Cine goers are still living in the age of Mr. India and 20 years back in time. Wake up and don't appreciate such garbage things. ROBOT is only for children."

ALL i have 2 say it was quite fun to watch and refreshing for Indian cinema and i give 7.5/10."

For this particular film, surely it is the hero (as well as the villain) -- the one and only Rajni! But did he meet the expectations? My answer would be NO!  I went to watch this film only because of Rajnikanth .. but after coming out of the hall, I felt like I was cheated.. what the hell it is? This movie has dreadful comedy scenes (which will actually make you cry), stupid dialogues.. everything looked so artificial! And on top of that the robot looks like an old joker..  Story line: Average.. nothing new Acting: not up to the mark... actually actors did not have the scope to show their skills. Aishwariya was like the epitome of dumbness! Rajni looked like an old man trying hard to do some martial arts as Neo did in Matrix.. but those scenes turned out to be hilarious!! Music: Disappointing.. the lyrics are horrible!! Visual effects: Good  My suggestions to people: Don't waste your time and money! go out with your friends.. have some good food instead of going through this painful movie!"

        "review": "Director Shankar and Superstar Rajnikanth are back after their last smashing hit, Sivaji- The Boss. And this time the visionary director explores the genre of science fiction by making the most expensive Asian film ever. The result? Well, that is what you have to decide, it really depends on how you like to enjoy it. And if you don't, as Rajni fans will say- \"the film isn't for you!\" Robot has an ambitious base, a superstar to start with; a huge financial backing and probably the makers already knew that the movie was already a hit as soon as it was announced. Even then the director strongly disappoints you by going the conventional way. Yes, 5 minutes into the movie, you know almost all the characters and their fate as well. There is the creator. There is the creation- Chitti. There is the antagonist, an old rival of the protagonist who wants to misuse the technology for that he wants the secret formula. There is the Creator's love interest who turns out to be the damsel in distress of every situation and also the root cause of every fighting sequence.  Who wouldn't have expected all this? But maybe that is the way masala movies are, you enjoy them exactly because of their predictability, you feel secure and are free to savour the little moments because you know that the heroine at the end is going to marry the good guy and you rest back in your seat knowing that the villain will die after a big fighting sequence. Maybe that is the beauty of a masala movie. But wasn't it a sci-fi action in the first place? That's where the movie gets confused actually! As it goes, one scene you have in which the protagonist creates a robot, the next scene you have him and his love interest dancing around peacocks in Kilimanjaro! Why mix the two worlds? Either create a subtle money minting masala like Sivaji or give us a hardcore Sci-fi affair! To be brief, the movie doesn't take itself seriously in the first place.  When you have figured all this out, you sit back and wait for your predictions to unravel on the screen. And it doesn't disappoint altogether. Surprisingly, its not Rajni's robot avatar that impresses you, it's his original charm as the scientist that will woo you and keep you waiting till he comes back on screen. Sadly, that happens very rarely. The main focus is always on Chitti, who turns out to be a stereotypical villain in the end.  When Robot gets fursat from the sing and dance routine, it delivers some high octane, mind boggling action set pieces. In the first half you have the graphical fight between Chitti and the goons in a high speed Chennai local. It isn't difficult to notice that Rajni isn't in control of this one, the director surely is. The screenplay though a cliché is smartly written except for a scene where Chitti converses with mosquitos. It had me hiding my face with embarrassment; So much money for the graphics of THAT scene? In the second half you have a speedy highway chase and also a giant robot chased by cops towards the grand climax.  The song lyrics in Hindi- are a torture, the choreography unforgivable. But Rehman's thrilling background score does rush some adrenaline through your veins.  So all in all, Robot is not that bad, it's just bore to the core. This is the film the kind of film in which you expect non-stop action and shaky camera to give the rugged look. But sadly that never happens as the producers seem to be obsessed with conventions that promise easy money.  A word of advice, non-Rajni fans, you won't miss anything if you miss it. Robot deserves a watch for the effort and ambition the director puts into it. Some things shown are never done in Indian cinema before.  I go with a rating of 2 out of 5 for director Shankar's Robot. If only they had given some serious treatment, instead of running on Shankar's inconsistent fantasy, the movie wouldn't have slumped to an average affair.  If the makers of ROBOT had made Cameron's Avatar, with Shankar's stereotypical treatment, earthlings wouldn't have reached Pandora in the first place!"

        "review": "When was the last time, you watched a movie and came out of a theater and then continued to talk about that movie for ages to come? If you have an answer, you have another opportunity and if you don't, you have your first 'experience' here! Director Shankar, director extraordinary comes with an Ento-sci-fie-thriller (Entertaining science fiction) ride and that's 'Robo' produced by Sun Pictures' Kalanidhi Maran! His trump card is Superstar Rajnikanth with four Aces being Aishwara Rai Bachchan as the heroine, AR Rahman for his expertise best known, Rathnavelu for cinematography and one whole Ace for his team that developed the special effects! If you are that die hard fan of Rajnikanth, you wouldn't need a review but you'd still want that loads of lines praising heaps on the Superstar! But here, you'll regret one thing – the invention of the dictionary! You won't really find one word to describe the true charisma and the on-screen persona of Rajnikanth, the undisputed Superstar of Tamil, oops Indian cinema! Man, he is just class, when it comes to style and performance! Let's dip in to the review in detail, don't worry, there will be no spoilers! The Gist of the Story Rajnikanth is a scientist, Vaseegaran who develops his brainchild, a robot. Names it 'Chitty' and teaches every single thing that this universe can hold. 'Chitty' is programmed to learn and know everything except for human emotions and when that is taught, how would you expect a machine to react? Watch 'Robo' to know how! Shankar, the captain! 'Robo' was apparently Shankar's vision which he envisaged 10 years back! So imagine the idea that rose almost a decade ago! Yes he has been inspired by Hollywood, the land of science fiction, but executing that in India with the 'Superstar' flavor is not an easy task. Shankar's knowledge on science and technology seems to be immense and he has conveyed his ideas to both rural and urban people with ease, thanks to simple, straightforward duologue's with due credit to Late Sujatha and young Karky. Shankar has adopted an uncomplicated screenplay that is enriched with entertaining elements that will make you realize how those three hours just flew! Dialogues The Superstar's fan following ranges from the villages to international cities and this being a movie talking about technology, one would expect totally technical jargon in place. But that's only a myth, because the duologue's in 'Robo' are simple and convey the message quite crisply making sure all the sections of the audience understand every aspect of technology and science. Now did that sound serious? The movie is neatly infused with comedy duologue's that will make you giggle and when rendered by Rajni himself, you'll just scream laughing! Visual Effects and Editing The teasers and trailers stimulated the curiosity thanks to the splendid visual effects by international technicians. Examples of the dynamic effects are a plenty to talk about in the movie but sample this – a robot with unimaginable powers confronts goons with his electromagnetic property and attracts their weapons, and voilà, you get to see, a spectacular scene that probably idolizes Goddess Kali! You'll have to watch it to understand and realize, it is verbally impossible to describe that scene and many other visual effects! Editing by Antony is crisp. Had the length been a little longer, the party would have been a little annoying! Stunts Not just for visual effects, Shankar has also used the services of international expertise for the stunts in his movie. Yuen Woo Ping, who worked on 'The Matrix', etc, has designed stunt scenes that will make your jaws drop! Our very own Peter Heines has also done his part. A sample to tease your curiosity – an intense car chasing scene with our Superstar making a 'donut' in his Mercedes Convertible! Exhilarating! Cinematography Rathnavel aka Randy, seems to have been born with a golden camera! He has produced visuals fabulously with all the songs being shot with right color temperature and lighting.  Aishwarya Rai – The Miss World, is amazing and truly an epitome of beauty! She forms an important part of the script and hence you'll spot her throughout the movie, perhaps for the first time a heroine is receiving considerable importance in a superstar's movie! The marvelous costumes add to her allure and she's just majestic in few scenes! Rajnikanth aka Superstar Saving the best (or the ultimate) for the last, Rajnikanth is one man who will not cease to amaze you! If your 6 or 60, you will be in awe of the man! In a movie which shows signs of visual effects riding in the driver's seat, the Superstar dominates every bit to walk away with appreciation! you just can't stop talking about him, once you come out! As the scientist Vasi, he plays his part uncharacteristically Rajni with out Punch duologue's or fights but as 'Chitty – the Robot' you are bound to follow or even turn an addict! Sample this – as a gentle Robo he is precise in acting and when it comes to the evil side, the incredible Rajni has made sure he doesn't waste his opportunity! His evil laugh, his characteristic slick walk, that body language and the dialog delivery in 'Robo' remind you of the golden Rajni time! Look out for the amazing dance moves by the superstar, given his age; a few moves are stunning, credits to the choreographers!"

        "review": "Man what a movie!!!! I just had the opportunity to watch this movie today and i was surprised by what i saw. For the first time watching an action scenes felt so real, which is very much unlikely in Indian movies. First when i heard of the movie i thought this must be some way related to I,Robot, the one that stars Will Smith, but i was deeply mistaken . So getting back to this movie it has awesome visuals and its almost like an Indian movie combined with a Hollywood movie. I gave 9 to this movie only for the sake that had it been a younger actor it would be much better. Well thats my feeling anyway but The Super Star does act really well as usual and guy who animated this movie i heard is the same one who was used for Matrix, he does a good job too and you can see it towards the ending. The music by A.R.Rehman is as awesome as always and Aishwarya looks as Beautiful as always and even does some decent dance steps. It could be termed as one of the films that will revolutionize the way movies will be made in future in India. Just don't miss out on this film. Its a must see if you are an Indian"

        "review": "Unnecessary random silly music numbers that stretch the movie to an arduous three hours. Childish, unfunny and, generally, dumb humor (you do get some laughs, but mostly at the movie and unintentional, like when that girl gets run over... (yeah, quality black humor right there, call me evil or something)). Plenty of other issues that I'll just blame cultural differences for instead of calling the movie plain dumb. Acting from absolutely horrendous to passable. Groan-inducing references to other movies. So what's good? Well, huge respect to the choreographer(s). The movie was generally well shot. The action scenes, while sometimes completely silly (the regenerating men in the train fight), can sometimes look good, be thrilling, and they are generally fun and well executed, better than in a lot of Western movies. They, like the effects, can go from brilliant to what-the-f**k in seconds though. A fruit of much effort, it fails miserably for trying to do and be too many things at the same time, and by doing those things badly. Plucked out of it's context, it fails even more. I don't regret watching it though, it was an interesting experience."

        "review": "This is the most awaited film in the recent time. Is it really worth waiting, I think certainly YES. The film is entertaining in every way. Laugh, romance, songs, action, message...,a complete entertainment package.  The story is very simple one line story. Then what makes this movie worth watching? First Rajnikanth. He did an amazing job and his performance alone make this movie worth watching. The role Chitthi got everything in it from romance,comedy to evilness. This is certainly one of his best. Second is Visual effects (The guys who did ground breaking visual effect movies like Terminator, Jurassic park up to recent Iron man and Avatar). They continue to amaze, its ice on the cake for them. The next is Shankar, who has given enough imagination to create the plot and thoughts to feed the special effect guys. The last 30 minutes were original and awesome. So did the writers, cinematography and costume.  After few great points, sadly it has some let downs. The thin story, many scene before climax were resembling some familiar action movies from Hollywood, but only minor. If you are regular Hollywood viewer, this film is quite average only. But for the people who don't, then it is a treat.  Music of AR Rahman - a let down for this film. Songs were ordinary, thanks to Shankar who shot well. But his background score was disappointing particularly in the second half chasing scene. As an Oscar winner he should have delivered better. He is got a record of giving good music (only) to big film and big directors. I kind of felt he did this film in a hurry. He should stop doing Indian films and concentrate on foreign films.  Overall this film will amaze Indian audience and Rajni fans. Well done Shankar to make this kind of film possible in India. A visual treat."

Really this one needs to be praised.

SHANKAR has used his wildest imaginations.He is fit to be the top director of Indian Cinema.Could have worked on the screenplay .slows down in KILIMANJARO but the presence of RAJINI does it all .!!  AISH is all of make up and nothing.I didn't like her.Sorry for her fans.  SPECIAL EFFECTS will let you down in scenes like the 'sphere' as we have seen sum Hollywood films. .but its the first kind in Indian CINEMA .!!!

        "review": "The most over-hyped movie in Indian film industry proves that it really deserves the hype and it lives up to it. The hype had begun a decade ago and it slowly increased to reach its peak when the soundtrack got released. It exploded like a volcano when the movie trailer got released. Now the movie itself got released and people cannot stop discussing about it for ages. It will make them to watch it again!  Will there be any such movie made in future? Yes of course! But this movie is something so exceptional!  Superstar  \"Why he has been said as Superstar?...has he really deserved it??\" If you ever had this question in your mind, you will really feel sorry for it. His performance in this movie, particularly Chitti 'the villain' robot will make you applaud spontaneously and you cannot control it. Superstar tops in his acting in all three roles as Dr. Vasigaran, Chitti robot and Chitti 'the villain' robot. The performance and expressions he has shown will make you to rewind the movies-'Netrikkan' and 'Moondru Mugam' in your mind. He is really a superstar.  Beauty star  \"Why each and every Indian man envies about Abhishek Bachchan?\".. Well, you once again have the answers for this question. There are many beautiful women in the world that can make the beasts to fall in love. But there can be only one woman who can make the machine to fall in love. Yes, only 'Sana' can make it and you cannot imagine anyone else in her role. The Kathak dancer proves once again that she deserves that crown!  Shankar  No one in Indian film industry can think of making such a movie like this. You can see it in the movie how he had imagined about the Robot and how it has been pictured flawlessly with a sensible screenplay. He made his dream come true by making the people to talk about this movie for this century. You can feel the efforts - a decade long pre- production, two years of film making, technicality and of course the value of 1900 million rupees. And it will not be embellished if we say that he is 'Steven Spielberg' of India film industry.  A.R. Rahman  If this movie was made in Hollywood, the eminent man would certainly move into the Oscar race once again! The master piece of music particularly the one with Symphony orchestras. it's tremendous!!!...without this man, the movie wouldn't have become such a magnificent victory.  Sujatha  The original story line written by Sujatha makes the movie so logical along with the sci-fi scenes. He actually lives in this movie and it's a tribute to that great legendary writer and scientist.  In few words  No one can think of making such a grand movie like this! No one can think of bringing such an acting talent like this!! No one can think of being so beautiful like this!! No one can think of composing such music like this!!  A must watch movie for at least 10 times!!"

        "review": "When was the last time you would have seen Rajnikanth \"acted\" in a movie without a punch dialogue (Mullum Malarum / Aaru Muthal Aaruvathuvarai). Probably Shankar (director) has got the best out of Rajnikanth.  With Rajni shouting as to \"Who is the black sheep\" and identifying it later \"maaah maaaah\" the theatre actually went blatant.  Aishwarya was gorgeous through the movie. Rahman was pleasant not to forget the Arima Arima song where 100's of Rajnikanth dance, it was mind blowing.  The special effects in the movie is damn good for a Indian movie and it has really set up a bench mark for all Indian Sci Fi/Action movie and Idon't expect this to be better for the next 5 years at least unless, Shankar himself recreates Endhiran 2. Probably after Mudhalvan Shankar has lived up to his fullest potential and thanks to the producers for giving Shankar such an opportunity if not Tamil cinema would have missed Endhiran.  Take A Bow Shankar & Rajni. You guys have made us proud."

        "review": "To start of with, this is not actor Rajini's regular movie.. You will not see Rajini uttering punch lines or doing different styles. Quiet different Rajini movie. But in negative role he is amazing.  Director Shankar has put lots of efforts to take it to international standards. Its an ambitious project, but could have upgraded the technique of creating robot in the film. Creating robot and imparting human emotions with just Apple computers is quiet annoying.  The first half of the film is very good. Scenes like robot Rajini talking to police, pointing Scientist Rajini as god for a question in Robot conference, asking who is goddess kali and people in that area believing him to be god after the weapons attracted to robot due to magnetic mode, and the action seq. in train are amazing.  But the second half has failed to maintain the tempo of the screenplay. There were few scenes which were unnecessary. The songs were shot nicely. Characters of Santhanam and Karunas are unnecessary. Robot Rajini as villain in 2nd half is excellent. Danny's role is wasted.  The last 30 to 40 minutes of the film is jaw dropping. Haven't seen this kind of seq. and great efx in Indian Cinemas. Great creativeness by director Shankar.  Despite of few flaws, VFX, CG and neg.role of robot Rajini covers those flaws. The film is great to watch. But if you watch the film expecting it to be at the level of Terminator series or Ironman series or iRobot, this film would be like toy film. Must watch it for director Shankar's efforts, his creativeness in climax and for great CG and VFX. Since this movie is first of this kind in Indian cinema, you must not expect much like other sci-fi Hollywood films. Appreciate director Shankar's efforts that he has taken, and has set landmark in Indian film..."

I can understand stunts being made in a grand manner, but not to the extent of foolishness. The last time I experienced such foolishness was during the last fight of Aalavandhan when the bad Kamal keeps chasing the other one.  Rajini is a good entertainer. Let him act in movies like Muthu, Veera, Annamalai, Baasha...rather than movies based only on mindless action.  I know most people would love to differ my views. What I have told is SAD, BUT TRUE."

        "review": "This to me is an out and out Shankar movie than a Rajini movie. He has worked on the minutest of the details. And kudos to him Tamil cinema has seen a first cut foray into Computer Generated Imaging and Animation. Super Star does steal the show in the last 30 minutes with his iconic villain role. I strongly feel Rajni should have doubled up as a villain in all his previous movies ( I am strongly inclined to imagine Rajini as Mark Antony in Basha , never to undermine an unpeccable performance made memorable by Late Raghuvaran)). And traces of his villainous dabbling has already shown up in his earlier ventures as well... Last 10 minutes of Chandramukhi , an unparallelled Netrikan , and an immortal Parattai in Pathinaru Vayathinile . The moments in this film where he make a cameo as a baddie is certainly his high point. Ash is simply amazing. After many uninspiring roles in the past couple of years this role will stand out not for her acting prowess but to have carried on a pivotal role with ease. The special effects and Shankar are the real heroes of the movie. Truth be told Rajni has grossly been overshadowed by these two factors. Rajni certainly did not disappoint but its the special effects and Shankars fast paced narration that gives the viewers the moneys worth. But I give a special 10 to this movie for making viewers realize that a Sci-Fi can actually be made so much enjoyable and logical. The last 45 minutes are awe-inspiring for a viewer of any kind. This is a special movie for Tamil Movie Fans for we haven't seen anything of this kind previously in Tamil Cinema. Certainly movie of the Decade for Tamil Cinema. Hope this movie will be a torch bearer for the globalization of Tamil Cinema that has a huge potential and a large pool of talent. A toast to Shankar and his 10 year old dream. A pat on the back for all the Technical crew of this movie. A job well done for all the actors . Thanks for a visual treat."

I am not a huge fan of B-movies, which is why i thought this was a terrible movie. CGI was quite bad through the whole movie. There where so many errors in the movie that i just had to laugh, several times i was like c'mon, this is just ridiculous.  Cars that clearly get damaged in one shot, is only a fender bender in the next shot, happens more than once. Unrealistic physics all over the place. Cars doing wheelies. People getting punched, kicked etc. through the air, but no injuries. Androids can't get bullet holes in clothes. About a 100 policemen firing assault rifles at the car and hitting it from all over the place, yet the women is not hit once.  The list goes on and on.  There where two other things i did not get, which kinda annoyed me.  The mix of English and Indian, it's kinda weird that in a conversation the first couple of lines are in Indian, then a line in English and then back to Indian again.  There are 4 music videos in the movie, which have nothing to do with the movie, and they are like actual music videos, length between 4/5 min. luckily i was watching the DVD so i could fast forward past them since they disrupt the movie.  But hey, then again, i'm not into B-movies and poorly made CGI, so this might be a gem for those who are."

        "review": "Again Superstar proved that he is one and only – SUPER STAR, in Endhiran. We are one day ahead of other Superstar's fans in India, lucky to watch Endhiran, just simply because of the reason we are here in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Viewed morning 10:30AM show September 30, 2010, and was surprised by seeing the houseful situation in Galleria Cineplex, Deira Dubai on Thursday morning, which is a half working day prior to weekend in this region , it is rare situation to see this kind of crowd in theater on working day, and it is possible only for Super star movie. To Put it in a simple statement, I can say for sure \"Enthiran is going to be a mega hit in the Indian film industry and there is no doubt in that\". Many Sci-fic films will come, but anyone can say that Endhiran is the one which changed the trend of Sci-fic movie made by Indian film Industry. Certain scenes with regard to technology and grandness are certainly new even for the Hollywood, thanks to Shanker's effort and the team of Stanley Winston – animation (Terminator, Jurrasic park, Aliens, Iron Man), Industrial light & Magic – visual effects ( Star wars, Jurassic park, Titanic, Avatar,Harry Potter,Last air bender to name few), Yuen Woo –Ping – stunt ( Fist of Legent, Matrix and The Forbidden Kingdom) and Raju Sundaram, Aishwarya Rai simply amazing. Kilimanjaro song at Machu Picchu , Peru (UNESCO world heritage site) and for the music of A.R.Rahman, there is no comparison. To be specific, the fight sequence in the metro train, the fire rescue scene and the last 25 minutes, are the punch and exciting shots which are never made in any world cinema. The quote which I read in a site stating \" Endhiran -150 Crore rupees entertainment for your family \" is not an exaggeration. By Endhiran, Super star has made sure that no territory left untouched by his magnetism. SUN PICTURES proved it's capability for delivering world class pictures."

He is plays a dual role in the movie one as Dr. Vasigaran, a scientist and other one as a humanoid robot. He has did so well in both the roles. For those who want the usual Rajini styles and punch dialogues, this is not the movie. This is more of a Shankar movie. However, with a huge scale of 165 crores production cost, none other than the superstar can recover the cost and make this awesome movie, a commercial success.  The richness of the movie is unparalleled and is the best in Indian cinema so far. The computer graphics in the end of the movie is top- notch and is easily on par with top Hollywood movies. Hats off to Director shankar for his courage in successfully directing such a niche subject to Tamil audiences by spending a whooping 165 crores of Rupees."

        "title": "The most technologically advanced Indian movie till date",
        "review": "Endhiran (Robot in Hindi and Telugu) is vintage Rajinikanth fare wrapped in glossy futuristic techno-savvy material. There are 3 Rajinis here to contend with - (1) Dr. Vasigaran who creates the titular Robot, (2) Chitti ver 1.0 the lovable Robot who at times reminds you of Robin Williams in Bicentennial Man, and (3) Chitti ver 2.0 who hugely reminds you of Rajini's Alex Pandyan in Moondru Mugam, except that this one is a 100 times more brilliant! The plot has been neatly drafted out, and the action scenes are spectacular! This is by far Shankar's most ambitious project and it shows in every frame. The storyline is simple - man creates machine, man teaches machine how to become human, machine absorbs the worst of human nature instead of the best and creates havoc while replicating itself, man destroys machine (that's a plot giveaway, but hello, do you think mainstream Indian fare would ever have the bad guys winning?) Rajni's performance as 3 different personalities is just perfect and reminds you of the actor Rajinikanth of yesteryear who had slowly given way for superstar Rajinikanth. He manages to emote well as Vasigaran, underplay as the emotionless Chitti, and be an over the top maniacal and supremely menacing Chitti ver 2.0! The fight as goddess Kali/Durga/whoever is delightful, the train fight sequence is whistle worthy fun, and the mind blowing special effects during the climax surpasses those one would have witnessed in recent super hero movies such as the Iron Man and Spiderman. No, I'm not kidding - the FX in the climax scene really are better and more jaw dropping than what Hollywood has offered us! The movie does has its yawn-evoking moments though they are thankfully few and far between - Vasigaran's romance with Aishwarya Rai(though the lady still manages to look gorgeous), the silly conversation with the mosquitoes and a couple of songs that weren't really needed. The one song that blows your mind is Arima Arima with a 100+ evil Chitti ver 2.0s, while the music of the title song ensures that your adrenaline gets pumped up right at the start of the movie! Having said that, this is not one of Rahman's best works.  This movie is for everyone who have been praying to see the Indian film industry rise to the level of Hollywood in technical finesse. This movie is for everyone who love Indian movies for their entertainment value, and not just for Rajinikanth fans. So, grab your popcorn, lean back in your seat, whistle a few dozen times when the superstar performs his stunts and have a wonderful time at the cinemas. This movie is the reason why people watch mainstream movies!"

        "review": "The movie is nothing but old wine packed in bottle.A typical old style Tamil/Rajni movie with mindless songs, brainless action/fighting, Hero levitating and beating up 1000s of goons all alone without even being touched by them, loud background music, special effects which are not so \"special\" and very noisy, substandard comedy, larger than life slow motion introductions! The screenplay and story as usual was one dimensional. The ending/climax was easily predictable and clichéd. And there's absolutely no plot worth talking about. This film is certainly not a classic or milestone in Indian cinema in my humble opinion. What bugged me the most were the stereotyped comedy scenes like the scientist fleeing the crime scene ,after the Robot seriously injured a traffic cop, rather than helping him out. The comic scenes featuring the assistants who don't even deserve a cup of coffee from the robot would drive any serious film lover nuts. And what was the director thinking by casting Aishwarya Roy as a medical college student opposite a senior scientist who clearly looks over 50 years old? Even though the comic scenes were not very comical, the logical loopholes in the execution of the script are ludicrous and laughable.  From the high overall rating this movie received in IMDb, which in general has always maintained a high standard, its once again proved that Indians in general have poor viewing standards. The film is strictly meant for the die hard fans. But for others who take cinema seriously and as a piece of art, this just isn't worth the money! Maybe this is what Indian movies are all about!"

But best thing of the movie is SHANKAR has came out with some new things to Indian cinema..Brave attempt. And the CGI looks pretty awesome for an Indian standard. Rajini acts well in the 2nd half. the movie's first half was good but the second half was a utter crap. The credit goes to the CAmera man who did an awesome job. Aiyshwarya Rai looked too good in this movie and her dance moves make a person jump out of the seat n enjoy..She was too good in the movie. The movie runs for 2hrs and 58 mins. Editing was not that much good there were many scenes which were too worse... there is a scene where a mosquito comes n speaks n all that and all utter crap.and this time A.R. has not done his best in his songs.Songs were not good at all....Just for two songs are good others are horrible wen u come out of theatre you wil forget those songs.. Climax scene was tooooooo lenghty but then the CG part was awesome in climax scenes. anyways Movie is not a good one its a bad movie."

        "title": "very good first half , so so 2nd half",
        "review": "I liked shankar more than maniratnam because of his brilliant script writing which enthralls the audience for 3 hrs with some brilliance, fantasy, larger than life persona and masala stuffs. But endhiran being his dream project has too much masala for a sci-fi film. This film would had been very good in 2001 even without the special effects.  1 st half is almost perfect for a 1st half with racy screenplay and acceptable storyline. I was at edge of the seat when chitti was delivering the baby, i was eager about chitti being approved for patent. 2nd half is pure cheese with chitti speaking to mosquito, three unnecessary songs and above all chitti doing all those magic stuffs only for aishwarya rai is so uninteresting. When the movie was over i was like \"this is it\", so is my friend beside me and so is my neighbour the other side.  the movie is very entertaining but it is masala film, DOT and the special effects isn't very good IMO. Black sheep mehnn mehnn mehnn... superstar forever."

        "title": "Nothing Less! Nothing More!",
        "review": "GLIMPSE - Almost 2 years of hard work, Whopping budget approx ~ 180 Crores +, The Superstar phenomenon, Oscar Winner's Music, Directed by Spielberg of south India, World beauty Aishwarya, Sun Pictures Production & Over 3000 Theatres Worldwide release. These huge Factors has raised the expectation for Endhiran, that had won the Altitude of everest so easily. Before review I admit that, \"I'm a die-hard Rajni fan from age 5\". But, this review is not gonna be one-sided.  FIRST HALF - Dr.Vaseegaran (Rajnikanth) is a scientist who strives hard to make an android Robot, for serving the society (Military).Being restless for 10 years, he finally succeeds in giving life to his dream project. The humanoid is named \"Chitti\" : Speed 1 Tera hertz (Terahertz radiation can pass through anything in microseconds except metal or water), Memory 1 Zetta Byte (A Zettabyte = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes).Aishwarya as Sanaa plays Rajni's girl friend, whom fits the role well, but.... is it fair to show rajni 'fairless, as an aged scientist with grown beards and shrunken eyes ? while he is in love with a college girl.. not at all Shankar sir.., u could have better exposed super star as he is capable of it. Santhanam & Karunaas play comedy roles as assistant's of Rajnikanth.Chitti itself does some funny acts and conversation which, provokes laugh now and then (Esp. Conversation with traffic police and when footballing the rowdies).Dr.Vasi displays his project to the world with a presentation, his own professor (Danny Denzongpaa) becomes rival against rajni's invention. The reason behind it was ego and his own failures with creation of such robot's. So, Danny as Bohra the professor of rajni, falsify the invention thro a mind play with chitti during final stage of evaluation before approval. So, the judges verdict's \"Chitti is very Dangerous to human society!\". Meanwhile Dr.Vasi doesn't lose hope and upgrades chitti to make understand the human emotions that includes Love, Sentiment, Happiness, Anger... Etc. Chitti picks it up well. This creates a problem to Dr.Vasi, as Chitti fall's in love with Sanaa for her extreme care n beauty. This happens as Dr.Vasi sends chitti to Sana's house for 2 days as a company for her exam preparation. In these 2 days, it does all super-hero miracles that includes a mind-boggling train fight. Aish kisses chitti for its efficiency. Here starts all the troubles. Chitti starts arguing with Dr.vasi and rejects his commands as it love's Sana. At one stage it proposes to Sanaa. But, she rejects & tries explaining the reasons to chitti. Due to these acts of Chitti, Dr.Vasi gets frustrated to the peak and demolishes his 'dream project' into pieces and throws out. The out-thrown Chitti was rediscovered by villain in the urban garbage disposing area of Chennai. The robot itself joins all the broken parts as main brain chip was active and asks for the help of Danny the evil professor.  SECOND HALF - The Villain, modifies Chitti and gives it a new avatar. But, with an installation of a red chip filled with full of evil thinking. Evil-Robot, announces itself as upgraded version 2.0. & with trademark villainous-laugh of Rajnikanth,\"Enna yaralayume alika mudiyaathu!\"(means - \"no one can finish me!\") Here starts the speedy screenplay.As Dr.Vaseegaran is about to wedlock with Sanaa, Anti-Chitti kidnap's her forcefully, It razes all the barriers and kills a lot of policemen, army persons, destroys big vehicles with Style... The best part is, \"It Carries a bunch of Powerful n heavy Machine gun's ready to bombard & says coolly... \"HAPPY DIWALI FOLKS!\" & fires them into ashes. This is the moment, where Audience's Whistle n applause fills the hall, that puts theater DTS as if in silent mode! The evil robot creates new robots. one makes the other and other makes some other...... but all r identical! At one point evil-robot kills the professor brutally, as he opposes its acts of multiplication. Then, It occupies Danny's hi- tech research building for creating 1000's of robot's that look alike. Dr.Vasi, makes a suspense plan to rescue Sana from its custody. The evil robot order resembling robots to safe-guard the building. Each is capable of killing many human forces by reforming into different shapes through chain-gang, that cant be destructed easily by any means. Anyhow Dr.Vasi manages to get into the core of building, by shaping himself like that evil-robot. He rescues aish by proving he is Dr.Vasi, thro a sharp cut in his hand with a knife. The evil robot identifies that there is Dr.vasi inside the building, with his blood drops on floor. It lines up all the robot's, and thereafter identification parade by Evil-Rajni is a class of his acting talents. Those 5 minute's action to reveal the black sheep is more than enough to answer, why he is still an \"EPITOME OF STYLE!\" Rajni rocks our mind with his anti-mannerisms @ 62. Rest is Mind-Blowing Climax with gigantic graphics!  MERITS : RAJNI as usual steels the show as Chitti & Anti-Robot. Aishwarya is like a Barbie doll with extra-ordinary dance and acting. (Now u know the reason, why rajni praised her a lot in all functions!) Animation & Graphics will challenge Hollywood. First Indian movie of its genre! RAJNI as Dr.Vasi acted normally without punches and grand introduction! (His die-hard fans may dis-like this). While, First half is sci-fi comedy, Second half is an enthralling roller coaster ride!  DE-MERITS : Shankar's usual touch was missing, A.R.R's BG score is not the best. Makeup and costumes not great as Anniyan or Sivaji. Over-hype and most important scenes revealed in trailer. Mosquito scene & Kalabavan Mani Scene not essential. Some characters are utter waste.(esp Rajni's parents,Karunas, K.Mani).  LAST BUT NOT LEAST : Everyone can dream, But there is a certain way of execution! \"Its not an usual Shankar or Rajni movie, yet u have tonnes of other reasons to watch it twice or even thrice!\""

        "review": "I got the chance to watch the special screening of this movie. And I don't want to reveal major storyline. In all ways it's a typical Indian mix. It got good songs, over the top action scenes and really bad SCI-FI storyline. Also the actors in this movie done a terrible work. But I think the Indian audience will only look for it's entertainment value. It got all ingredients for a mainstream movie. I think it will satisfy family and young audience alike. But today most of the \"main stream\" audience move away from gimmicky movies, this film has to prove itself in it's value, and it's uniqueness. I have to give credit to the director. He done a great job for assembling major talents, technicians for this project. Any way give it a try. Good for a single viewing experience."

        "title": "Copy of lots of Hollywood movie into one masala flick",
        "review": "I expected it to be copy of Hollywood movie but it had scenes and ideas of too many movies. The film starts with Superstar Rajni in his lab working out his robot and gradually the robot is made to have emotions which makes him love the creators fiancée and when creator finds it out he destroys the robot, finally to be revived by rival scientist to become the EVIL robot. Finally the hero gets into the villain's den and asks heroine to put up a show,but it wasn't complete success and around that time villain robot finds that his creator has entered his home, and then lots of over-made scenes of animation and then finally hero accomplishes to trap him in an electromagnetic and deactivate him. In the court the creator is given death sentence while the robot shows it was the rival who made hm like this by making an addition to his neural systems. The final verdict was The creator was pardoned and the robot to be dismantled The movie is something that we haven't seen in movies made in India.  The things I found annoying were 1. Micro/mini dressed overacting Aiswarya Rai 2. Story of Bicentennial Man(to become a human) with A.I(to gain love of mother in AI but here heroine) 3. Robot's power resembles X Men's character Magneto's power,even same sequence of not using iron objects in front of Villain robot. 4. The action sequences inside train resembles action sequences in Matrix Reloaded(the scene where neo for the first time sees Smith),the car sequences also reminded of highway action sequences in Matrix reloaded. 5. The place where the robot tries to save human but was actually hurting human(the fire escape scene) resembled Spiderman and the jumps that of I Robot. 6. The climax was utter boring. 7. Talking to mosquitoes and making it beg for mercy........ewww uckkkkk 8. Unnecessary comedies by 2 assistants of the scientist. The kaali scene was the only authentic scene in the movie"

        "review": "A movie made with graphics. Can see glimpses of Transformers, Crank, Ironman, Terminator and Hulk. The first half can entertain you with a few comedy scenes and songs. As compared to first half, second half won't entertain you much. You can witness the usual Rajini stunts and styles. The music and BG score by ARR and sound mixing by Resul Pookkutty is not that interesting. Just a usual one. To be precise, I was not able to see the ARR/Resul magic in it. But still, overall, its a nice watch. Even if you're not a Rajini fan, watch it for the brilliant graphics and technical perfection. Will rate 7/10.  P.S:- When the movie head towards its climax, there is a scene in which Rajini and his clones form a huge snake. Amazing. A must watch in theater."

        "review": "The movie way hyped up by the collaboration of superstars of Tamil cinema. Lot was expected of Endhiran as it was proclaimed as the most expensive movie made in Asia. But for me it was disappointment all the way. The special effects took the lime light with a wafer thin story line. The hero, Vaseegaran, played by charismatic Rajinikanth is top Indian scientist who creates a Robot in his own image. Vaseegaran's girlfriend is Sona played by Aishwarya Rai Bachan. The story is how the Robot becomes evil and the Good scientist overcomes the evil Robot. This story line has been common from days of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. The kind of Special effects is new to Tamil Cinema and it is good but becomes very cheeky at times, especially at fight sequences. The movie is held together by the super star Rajini as good scientist and evil Robot. The characterization and screen play could have been crisp and tight. Sometimes simple logic of realism is lost in the story telling. I would give 5/10"

Shankar is the god for a new genre Sci-Fi 'MASALA'.  Resul pookutty is awesome.  Sujatha sir we miss you. Without his dialogues you will doze off in the theatre.  Three people save this movie Rajini (Super Star), Rajini (Underplaying hero), Rajini (Callous Robot).  Shankar should read some AI books. AI is not a concept which can be used just like that in your contemporary period movie."

Storywise it was like avatar \"tech. dominated the story\" But if you consider the performance \"it is much better than avatar.\" The childish lover Chitti was awesome. The Chitti v.2.0 was equally good. It it is definitely the best movie India has ever made. Shankar did good good by avoiding too much SciFi aspect Because Indian audience would have trouble digesting it for a while. Showing the A.I as an accident (thunder) was brilliant. Had some part of bicentennial man hidden in the screen play. Shankar should try space movie or a multi-starer with top Indian actors like Rajini,Chiru,Vijay,Mahesh Babu & Pawan kalyan. Bollywood have spoiled the Image of Indian cinema on the international scale. we need these kind of movies to show them what is the real Indian cinema."

Enjoyed each and every frame of the movie. Songs are excellent and the locations are superb. Rajini has danced superb in this movie. The song which I enjoyed the most was the climax song \"Arima Arima\". Aishwarya looks very beautiful in the movie and her dance movements are excellent. The second half shows the director's imagination. One thing I didn't like there was no Rajini introduction scene and no punch dialogues for him. We celebrated the movie as a festival. Go and enjoy the movie."

The movie is subtitled in English and my better half who doesn't understand Tamil was able to enjoy it too. The first half was full of character development,this was done in a light hearted manner and there are many laugh out loud moments The second half has more action scenes and CGI stunts than you can count on your fingers and toes. On the whole Rajini carried off the movie in impeccable style and you are left gasping for breath as you witness one death defying stunt after another. There is a lot of ingenuity in the action sequences,many are unlike any I have seen in Hollywood movies. On the hole I would say that regardless of whether you are a south Indian or north Indian or not an Indian go and watch the movie ...it wont disappoint.Even an hour of the movie is worth the admission price"

The actions are like never before in Indian cinema, it takes the Indian cinema to completely new level. It is like taking roller coaster ride from the begin to end. It is ride which is goes smoothly at the beginning and in the end it takes you the mind blowing thrill like you never experienced before. The last 45 minutes of the movie and the climax would be talked, debated by everyone during their work, studies and it going to be discussed at length. This movie has set new standard of how Indian cinema should be made. This is going to be trend for future movies to come and going to change the Kollywood, tollywood, bollywood alike. Everything about it is fantastic, the cinematography, the editing, the screenplay, the music, the actions, the graphics has all been done superbly. Watch it, feel it and enjoy it.

The director Shankar has tried really hard to match the film up with the standards set by Hollywood and for Indian cinema standards, he takes big steps towards that dream. The graphics and the CG work in the film is truly spectacular. The first half is racy and filled with lot of feel good moments. The second half starts off slow, but picks up momentum right before the last 40 minutes. The last 40 minutes is a RIOT and at the end it leaves us breathless!!! Rajnikanth fits into the character of a Robot like a glove, and Aishwarya Rai looks stunning and dances like she has a spring in her feet. Rahman's music comes alive with the visuals, which are shot very beautifully by Shankar. But his background score could have been better. The sets for the movie are very grand and stylish as per the standards set by Shankar. Director Shankar is the ultimate winner, and Indian cinema should salute him for enhancing its reputation"

Class, appeal for the masses, awesome background score, bad ass action and great song sequences! Shankar is like India's James Cameron! The sci-fi movie's plots reminded me of Michael Crichton's Prey... The dialogues of the evil Robo are awesome! The song sequences are brilliant! Awesome music along with great lyrics have already created a stir! With choreography matching the lyrics, its simply too good! For example, in the song Arima Arima, Aishwarya's dance steps are like a deer when the lyrics goes \"pon maan kadaithaal yamma, summa viduma\" (Roughly translates to \"will I let alone a golden deer like you\").  One might say it was a tad too long (2 hours 52 minutes), but that's acceptable, right? Even Avatar was a little too long. But, the plot demands it! Nevertheless, a total entertainer! Just go ahead and book your tickets, unless they are already sold out!"

        "title": "Iron Man of Indian Cinema",
        "review": "Happened to watch this movie yesterday. I should say that the movie has exceeded my expectations. Shankar has scored big time with this amazing movie. The movie basically has a very thin storyline. But it has taken Indian cinema to the next level in terms of graphics and technology. 1st half of the movie is entertaining. 2nd half is a bit dragging initially, but the last 40 minutes is visual treat with about 1000 Rajni's rocking on screen. Shakhar has done a neat job. Not even a single scene seems to be inspired from a Hollywood movie. Shankar deserves special applause for his imaginations and his ability in bringing them successfully on screen, especially the graphics. Unbelievable graphics never seen before in Indian cinema. Though I always admired Rajnikanth as a performer, rarely I've seen him on screen as an actor. After a long time, may be after Thalapathi I once again saw the actor in Rajnikanth shining. He was amazing as Dr.Vaseegaran, Robot Chitti and Chitti version 2.0. All three characters were very much different from each other and the Superstar has done an unbelievable job. Chitti version 2.0 will be a treat for Rajni fans. Considering the amount of effort Shankhar has put in, I feel A.R.Rahman hasn't given his best. That was a pain for a die-hard ARR Fan in me. But it is a fact that no one other than ARR in Indian film industry could have brought in at least these songs. Anyway he scores big time with the BGM in the second half. BGM for Chitti version 2.0 and climax symphony BGM(a variation of Arima Arima) are great stuff. Typical ARR stuff. Song picturization was not great as previous Shankhar movies. But watching the song Arima Arima on screen is a pleasure. Overall I would call this a perfect Indian masala movie with superb graphics which can easily be called Iron Man of Indian Cinema."

Rajini is the only match for rajini both hero as well as Villain. Rajini did a great job as Chitti babu. Danny scene was showed as glimpse that he will be a great Villain but not :(.  Last 30 mins is Damn too good!!! Climax is the Jewel in the crown. Santhanam and Karunas were wasted in the role of the comedians, in fact rajini did comedy netter when compared to them. Aish was shown more beautiful. Some unwanted scenes are made inserted in the movie like the scenes before the 'Kilimanjaro' song. I personally felt glimpse of the Terminator Salvation, and the Agent Smith of Matrix reloaded like scenes in the movie, but no way they are related, this is IMO.  Strictly a good family entertainer and last speech by the robot rajini is awesome regarding the humanity."

        "title": "Not your typical Rajini Movie",
        "review": "From the very first scene of the movie, director Shankar makes it clear that this movie is not going to be the usual Rajini movie that his fans have come to expect and sets the expectation that it will be the director's movie. Fans expecting \"Punch Dialogues\" and dashing entry of their \"thalaivar\" are going to be disappointed. Rajini looks good, with all the trim suits, nice wigs, cool shades and flashy beard. And I'm not going to get tired of saying this - Aishwarya looks drop-dead gorgeous. In some frames, she's looks mesmerizing, the effects amplified by the costumes, locations and lighting; so much so that one doesn't even realize that Rajini's there too - and that's saying something.  On performances, not surprisingly, Rajini plays the role of Dr. Vaseegaran with ease. It is in the role of the android that he has a blast. And one really gets to see few really well conceptualized and enacted scenes involving the robot. The scene at the hospital where Chitti is kissed by Sana and then begins to feel differently towards her is one scene that stands out. Aishwarya as Sana does well. And she looks stunning.  There are quite a few aspects about the movie that do irk though. The overall length of the movie. Absence of comedy for most parts (Santhanam and Karunas have been wasted). Danny has been wasted in a thankless role. Seeing that the lip-synch was not good either and there wasn't really much scope to perform for the Prof. Bhora's character, I do not understand the reason they went for Danny. With a southern actor, at least the dialogues could have been delivered more convincingly. A.R. Rahman's music is certainly not his best and most songs seem to have similar techno music. The BGM doesn't impress either. And it doesn't help that few of the songs were shot lazily. The first song and the Kilimanjaro song (which is probably the only hummable song in the movie) were shot at breathtaking location (yes, singular, just one location). You see the lead stars running around the same location throughout the length of the songs, with just the costumes changing. Coming from someone who made one song across the seven wonders of the world in 'Jeans', this was a letdown. Aishwarya has been given some ridiculous costumes in the Kilimanjaro song, but manages to look ravishing in every song.  It can be safely said that this movie has gone few notches more than any other Indian movie ever has in the technical department. The makers have made good use of the much-hyped budget of the movie. I'd go as far to say that the effects were better than what I saw in a few Hollywood movies, which are typically made with thrice the budget of Enthiran. The greatest plus for the movie is definitely the special effects. And then there is the lovely Aishwarya Rai.  It is clear that Shankar wanted the emotional turmoil within the Robot to be the driving force of this movie. But somehow, that fails to transpire on the screen, despite the best effort from the director and the actor Rajini. What you get finally is roller-coaster ride of excellent special effects. Coming to think of it, why would the makers want Rajini for this movie anyway. Rajini's major strength is his demi-god status and his fan-base. It goes without saying that Rajini is talented too and is not all about style, and he has proved it time and again. However, this movie neither plays to his fans (something that K.S. Ravikumar's 'Padaiyappa' did), nor does it have the scope for a power-packed performance from Rajini (something that we had seen in Mani Ratnam's 'Thalapathi'). So, one really thinks if Rajini was needed in this movie after all and whether this would have been equally engaging (to whatever level it is) if someone else had played the role that Rajini did.  In all, this is not your typical Rajini movie. You can enjoy it if you're not the front-row Rajini fan. And watch it for the beautiful Aishwarya Rai."

        "review": "I had not seen any Indian movies but when I saw this recommended in the news paper I thought it might be something interesting so gave it a go. I must say it was different; I knew to expect some song and dance numbers but assumed when they occurred it would be like a Hollywood musical where characters broke into song but here they didn't just sing they were in totally new surroundings and costumes! The story was easy enough to follow; Dr. Vaseegaran creates a robot, later named Chitti, in his own image which he intends to give to the Indian army to help defend his country. The problem is his rival Dr. Bohra points out a flaw; Chitti has no emotions and no sense of right and wrong so will do whatever ordered. Vaseegaran sets about giving Chitti emotions but this only makes matters more complicated as his creation falls in love with his beautiful girlfriend Sana! At this point Vaseegaran destroys his creation and disposes of it at the city dump; he hadn't however anticipated that Bohra would fix Chitti and give him the sort of upgrades that would turn him into a psychotic killing machine... that was still obsessively in love with Sana. If Vaseegaran is to save Sana he must defeat Chitti and the army of duplicates he has created!  It is hard to assign his film into any one genre; it is obviously science fiction, showing obvious influences from films like 'The Terminator' and 'The Matrix'; there are also several musical interludes, some of which are fairly high camp, some fine comic moments and even a romance thrown in for good measure! Actor Rajnikanth (credited as Superstar Rajni!!!) does a fine job in the duel roles of Vaseegaran and Chitti; frequently he goes a bit over the top but that is just what the film demanded. Co-star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is also good as his Sana, I cane see why even a robot would find her attractive! Danny Denzongpa, who plays antagonist Dr. Bohra is great in his part although sadly it isn't as big as it could have been due to 'Evil Chitti' taking over as the main villain. The film is packed with action; most of it looks great although it is let down by poor special effects in places; the various forms of multiple Chittis looked great but the helicopters they attacked looked like something out of a slightly dated video game which was a pity. The comedy varies from the slapstick to the totally surreal; the scene where Chitti has a conversation with a swarm of mosquitoes is one of the strangest I've seen in any film... including those where characters are meant to have take large quantities of weapons grade hallucinogens! Despite these flaws or perhaps because of them I enjoyed this and would recommend it to people wanting something a little different from standard western fare... I'll have to watch more Indian films to find out how different it is from those though!"

What a shame! Shankar tried to praise the whole movie by showing tank full of Special effects & it describes how that huge amount of money used by the fu%^&* director.Plot contains some major holes. Although the visual effects are good but some times they are very cheesy like the scene where Chitti (The Robot) trying to save some peoples from fire.Music is not memorable. This whole movie meant for only the die hard fans of Rajni.Aish done a good job.Not a movie to be watch more than once."

I seriously began to question their and my mental health once the movie began. It was an Indian movie . Period. Which means that the story was pathetic and predictable . There were many (many) songs. The high budget had more to do with the cost incurred due to shooting on foreign locations than writing a decent script.  The movie started of as something tolerable but ended up becoming a monstrous implement of torture.  The movie failed to land. It actually never took off. The humour was quite dim witted and not original.  Any one who has any inclination to become a suicide bomber should watch this movie for it teaches one how to destroy oneself as well as all those around it without breaking any sweat."

        "review": "First thanks to Director Shankar for making such a dumb movie in the name of scifi and calling it a dream project.This movie was just a CHEAP version of Artificial intelligence,Bicentennial Man,Astroboy and even Steel (1997 American superhero film )  Chitti is an exact copycat of Gigolo Joe in Artificial intelligence The stunt sequence were Chitti uses his electromagnetic power is copycat of Steel (1997 American superhero film )  \"He is none other than my creation CHitti THE ROBOT speed 1 tera hertz ,memory 1 Giga bytes\"  seriously whats this????  The opening scene was OK if you exclude Santhanam and Karunas comedy.  Well !If you are used to Hollywood movies and if you are sci fi movie fan,then this movie is just an adulterated version of Bicentennial Man & Astroboy with some scenes totally ripped off from Artificial intelligence,I.robo ,hellboy and even Steel (film).But good attempt though!  My review :It started off good (excluding Santhanam&Karunas) then lost its momentum towards the end.And about the CGI it went from good to bad and post interval it was like watching Amman(movie)padam graphics.  I really wish the director spend sometime on the script rather spending on the songs which were totally unnecessary for a scifi movie.  I really cant believe people call this movie amazing blah blah blah....  i am sure they said because of super star but except him this movie is same as SIVAJI :The boss which was again a dumb movie.  AHH GOD SAVE TAMIL CINEMA!!!!!!!"

But other than Rajni, Aishwarya Rai and the visual effects, there is nothing interesting or brilliant in this film. What i felt was it's neither a Rajini's film nor a Shankar's film, neither a commercial entertainment nor a brilliant informative flick, this film lies somewhere in between. Dr.Vaseekaran, a great scientist scolding a machine that he has made shows the heights of stupidity. Mosquitoes speaking human language is not something a good director should include in such a fiction. Story was fine but the screenplay was not that good especially in the second half and towards the end. I didn't want to say its bad but still thinking about the budget and the resources the director had for this film i can say that it could have been better. This is the most expensive film in Asia. We can customize an international concept to a particular set of People but not in this way.. You can watch the first half once. I am really disappointed with this film. 5/10"

Anyone who has watched movies like Transformers, Terminator or Avatar would agree that Endhiran's CGI was awful. Sure it was better than other Indian movies attempt at CGI - but nowhere near believable.  The first half of the movie was good as it shows us the benefits of having a robot with 1 Terahertz computing power. But the story starts to become cheesy when the robot is given the ability of \"feel\" and think like human beings. The ending sequence looked like it was written by a 6 year old. Hundreds of robots combining to form a ladder & then a snake??? ...really"

        "title": "Solid Effort but far from perfect !!!!!!!!",
        "review": "I ll probably be labelled as the biggest dick in the universe for saying anything negative about this movie but after seeing that Science Fiction, which is my favorite genre of all time and being a die hard fan of Cameron and Spielberg for years I have to say that although this is by the far the best visual effects extravaganza in Indian Cinema ( credit Stan Winston Studios) it falls flat on a significant number of levels.  Straight off I ll get the two major elements that put this film on edge - Rajnikanth's acting as the android and the visual effects really stand out. Even though the entire plot basically was riding on his shoulders he gave a solid and engaging performance that really is extremely hard to pull off. Kudos to his commitment to bring stability to the two lead characters in the film and the contrast that he portrays between being a protagonist and antagonist was near perfection. The second important aspect of this film to be analyzed are definitely the visual effects . The prosthetics used here are a landmark in the Indian Film Industry - of course the models are reminiscent of i-robot n the t 800 . Nevertheless a lot of time and work has been done to make the visual effects really immersive and photo realistic- an excellent milestone. The climatic scenes definitely make the experience really memorable and the solid work of the visual effects artists were brilliant.  However much the hype of this film we have to look some other major elements which in my opinion fall apart . The story really is linear and predictable . I know even avatar did not have a strong story but at least it was executed with masterful skill - something that is visible missing in this film. S. Shankar's works have been brilliant in the past but in the age where a movie like Inception exists he needs to set the bar higher and focus more on cinematic perfection than crude commercialism. The acting was extremely sub standard except for the robot. The dialogs were laughable and were immature.I know its very hard to please the fans and give something that genuinely stands out but this opportunity was wasted and what came was a product of what has been selling in the market for years .Its time to take a step back and push for perfection. The editing was really bad. The abuse of the slow motion and close up shots really corrupt the experience.  Despite the setbacks this is definitely a must watch - at least once to appreciate that Indian films are entering the future landscape of Science Fiction and perhaps will make a much bigger impact in the coming years. However the industry has a lot to learn and this movie may be the first step in initiating it."

        "title": "A Nutshell Review: Endhiran",
        "review": "I have to admit that I haven't seen much of Superstar Rajnikanth's films in their entirety, other than the wonderful Annamalai many, many years back, and it firmly remains one of my favourites, so you can imagine the thrill of watching the Superstar on the big screen cementing his status as one of Kollywood's greatest again. He plays two roles here in a biblical take on creation, being the scientific creator Dr. Vaseegaran who's latest achievement after 10 years, is to develop a robot (christened Chetti by the Dr's mom) with an advanced neural networks, which is also played by the Superstar himself devoid of emotions, because feelings is something every computer scientist knows we're not quite there yet since programming more than not involves codes of logic, the rational and things explainable through maths, rather than the irrational based on emotion.  But being human is to have feelings and to express them, and that primarily separates machines from humans. In essence the story, besides being a romance, is an examination into the difference between man and machine, and the caution that should one day we get to such an advanced state of artificial intelligence that Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics have to be seriously looked into, and if one can truly program irrationality, then bear in mind that it comes with the negative traits associated with being human, Vaseegaran finds out that playing god and the proud acknowledgement of that ability comes with a degree of responsibility outside of hugging his creation each time it sings his praises, before the narrative turns in the second half into something darker, with betrayal and the severance of ties between Vaseegaran and Chetti.  And all this because of a woman too. The story before the interval dwells more on the romance or lack thereof between Vaseegaran and Sana (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), and takes on a rather playful nature in between the creation of the titular robot, and that of his abilities in assisting Sana through her studies, whipping up gastronomical meals, beating up thugs who disturb the peace, and provided for an entertaining fight sequence onboard a train involving the systematic destruction of the train cabin as thugs get slammed left, right and center by Chetti, which I'm sure in a packed house will have audiences applauding with approval. Bit by bit we see what Chetti is capable of, and highlights Vaseegaran's claim that it can dish out efficiencies and strengths of 100 men, before it starts to take on a new challenge in understanding feelings and emoting them, and with Love being as irrational as it is, proves to be a handful for a robot's comprehension as he starts to get romantically obsessed with Sana.  But Chetti, in disappointing terms, is created none other than as a weapon for the army, which I thought geared very much to the real world where anything that can be weaponized will, running contrary to the fantastical take of the narrative thus far, which provided a talking point for the filmmakers to preach about the virtues of love over war, and why man cannot for once abandon that thought for love, which we are equally capable of. Embarrassed by his creation, Vaseegaran destroys Chetti only for his rival (Danny Denzongpa) to pick up the pieces and provide his own little code to transform Chetti into a killing machine, which provided for almost all the action sequences in the second half of the film to the point of excessiveness, an opportunity to see the Superstar in hundreds of numbers creating an army of itself and a fortress in which to house the kidnapped Sana. And trust me when I say the final act of the film involves some very loud battles between robots and soldiers that made it seem like you're watching a disaster flick with Transformers.  Clocking in at 170 minutes, there were a few redundant scenes here that could have been done away as it didn't move the narrative forward, like the scene involving Chetti communicating with mosquitoes (yes you read that right). The action sequences in the film are unlike what I've seen in any Indian film to date, and puts them on par with what Hollywood does in terms of designing and executing them flawlessly between live action and computer animation, though at times it's easy to detect where the money shots were placed. A.R. Rahman's music provided the right touches in the film although I would think the song and dance numbers were a little long – especially those that came in to justify the love between Vaseegaran and Sana – that were made bearable only by the excellent dance choreography, which both Superstar and Aishwarya seem very comfortable in performing.  Like a typical Indian masala film, this one has the right mix of everything – song, dance, action, romance, and plenty of effects thrown in to make it look ahead of its time. for being an entertaining broad crowd pleaser. Superstar Rajnikanth is at his element here playing 3 different roles - the professor, the good Chetti and evil Chetti, and anyone who suspects Aishwarya's dance ability should be convinced without a doubt she has all the right moves here, because that's what actually shines through given her rather muted role as the medical undergraduate at awe with her boyfriend's ability to build a walking, talking and feeling robot protector. All in, Endhiran is a case in point in the maturing of the Indian film industry in terms of their technical knowhow, just like how the advanced Chetti got created as a labour of love."

        "review": "First of all am a serious Rajini fan!!Went to watch this movie on the first day of release.....and was and am greatly disappointed.  My first opinion on Indian cinema was that if they had the budget of any Hollywood movie , we could easily beat those English cinemas.Here came a very good opportunity for Indian cinemas and the result....?  Within the first few minutes of the movie you realize that this is just an another letdown by a very good director.There is little or no correlation between the scenes and incidents just seem to spring here and there in a random manner.Rajini's role in the movie is Okay...Aish is not given a good make up(Of course She looks lovely) and the songs.....  Everything that is done with difficulty in a Holly. movie(or at least they try to make it somewhat logical) is done very very easily here...In most holly. movies making of any robot is shown as a series of tough processes..But here Rajini just creates a robot and that too a humanoid with ease(May be Shankar did not want his viewers to get confused....but I wanted to see more...).The funniest thing is when the villain asks Rajini if he could program chitti to have feelings,Rajini does it with ease ....he just clicks a button(or something like that) that says 'Simulating Hormone Package\"(there were some scenes with a white-board...But that was it!!) ...Didn't any one else find this ridiculous?  This is supposed to be the most expensive movie till date in Indian History...that too of science fiction genre but the movie revolves around some feeling(according to Shankar it is 'love')between a girl and machine.Come on guyz we can make movies with much more sensible stories than this.  This is supposed to be Shankar's DREAM PROJECT and he has been planning this for at least 5 years.But the story makes it seem like it was cooked minutes before the Shooting had started.I was a great fan of Shankar(Anniyan,Shivaji) but surely am not anymore.  If you are a serious Rajini fan then there are a few moments in this movie for you(Some Thalaivar Moments)...and if not then this movie is just a waste of your time.  I have given three stars for this movie only because of some incredibly good fight sequences and some state of art animation sequences(Comparing with Indian Standards).Again I wish to mention that am a serious fan of our Superstar and this movie has hurt me very badly.  I wish that our Sup'Star would take more care on the story and script of his future movies.  ENTHIRAN has opened up a genre in modern cinemas.....SCI-FI MASALA:):)"

        "title": "Highly anticipated...and a well disguised BAD film",
        "review": "I am fairly disappointed in rating this movie as I'm a huge fan of Shankar and am a true admirer of his message-through-film approach. But, unfortunately he's made this movie just for getting huge box-office collections which as he mentioned some time back as \"against his principles\".  The film starts with a professor(Rajni)who designs a Robot and makes it to work after ten years of his hard work(as he describes) and starts making new modifications to it after each and every rejection of it, by a bunch of Scientists. And with the modifications made the Robot(Chitti) turns into a bad one and tries to kill the professor.  The acting was fairly good from all. Rajni has performed as usual- SUPERB(no wonder why people call him a SUPERSTAR).Aish did her part well and so are the rest of the crew. The film has high quality locations, excellent music and mind-boggling Graphics.  But the main disappointment of this film is the lack of the most important aspect-STORY. However, both Shankar and Rajni doesn't make you feel the lack of it in the first half. But, the stupid comedy sequences and the nil-quality dialogs of the BAD ROBOT makes you feel uncomfortable. However, a glimpse of anxiety creeps into you by the end of the movie(credits to the Graphics).But, overall this is the first badly made movie by Shankar.  The film has no scenes of I ROBOT but certainly the director has adapted most of the ROBOT sequences from the English movie I ROBOT. The only difference b/n I ROBOT and the ROBOT is: I ROBOT had excellent story, nice performances and well edited while the Indian version i.e., ROBOT has only the performances by the actors in comparison to the above factors.  Finally, I recommend this movie to the public who've never watched an Hollywood movie, because once you're familiar to Hollywood movies this film will appear like an absolute joke. I give this film a 5/10 because of the respect I have towards Shankar and the star-cast that made this film at least watchable."

        "title": "Rajni forever",
        "review": "Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem 'The Brook' ends with the words 'For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever.' This was the first thing I thought of when the end credits rolled on Shankar's latest magnum opus – Endhiran, The Robot. The reason these words seemed extremely apt was because it applied both to the robot on screen and the human – Rajnikanth – off screen. With Endhiran, Rajni has proved as clear as daylight, that he is still a Herculean force to reckon with. Rajni's image as an actor has grown so immense now, considering the colossal height it was at earlier anyway, that he has gone beyond reviews and critique. Nevertheless, despite my dwarfed mortality in the presence of Rajni's divinity, I shall still attempt this one.  With Endhiran, Rajni the actor makes a conscious comeback. There are no lines or superhuman antics here constructed specifically to get wolf calls from the audience. No. The scientist in Dr. Vaseegaran is just a regular guy who is a major robotics geek and despite having a girlfriend who looks like Aishwarya Rai (this time literally of course), the good doctor chooses to spend more time on his first major creation – Chitti, the humanoid and the real reason the audience will go wild in the cinemas.  Chitti pretty much has everything that is human. In a tongue in cheek attempt at capturing the essence of this 'everything', a hilarious exception is mentioned – feelings. Yes, Chitti is devoid of any feelings since he is a machine. Despite the overwhelming wealth of knowledge Chitti has been fed with, if there is one thing he doesn't comprehend then it is those fundamental units that form the rudimentary human pattern that go beyond a DNA model or a genetic theory. Feelings of shame, hurt, anger, lust, love, regret, jealousy, greed – a wide spectrum of colorful modes that Chitti hasn't been introduced to yet. At one point in the movie, having enraged the doctor after making a huge erroneous judgment call, Chitti accuses his creator of being flawed. This, he reasons, is why the logic in his machinery is flawed too. In another brilliant scene when asked if God exists, Chitti shoots back – 'Who is God?'. On being told it is someone who created us, he responds point blank – 'This is Dr. Vaseegaran. He created me. So he is my God.' It is in moments like this that Shankar's brilliance as an individual who recognizes the importance of a human element in a divine spectrum becomes refreshingly apparent.  With things looking this simple – something complicated happens. Chitti falls in love. With whom? Why the good doctor's girl of course! What bigger challenge than to pit Rajni against Rajni, right? A perfect and, quite possibly, penultimate gauntlet that is thrown down masterfully by Shankar in the pit. Wronged, Chitti makes a return in a whole new avatar as Endhiran – the evil robot – in the second half for sweet redemption. And what a return that is! If ever there was a Rajni movie with the most beautifully choreographed special effects in its final hour, it is hands down Endhiran. The ruthless confidence that Chitti/Endhiran brings to the screen lights up the climactic portions. It is here that Rajni the actor gets to bloom in full. The special effects team, as already heralded by millions as being the best, definitely deserves accolades for having converted a beautiful vision into an equally well choreographed outcome. In all my years of watching Indian cinema, I have never seen such amazing display of sequences built solely on mathematical and scientific models. The way Endhiran organizes his army of clones to fight off Vaseegaran's onslaught is certainly a cinematic milestone.  The visuals complement the story as does the music. Rahman gives us a pleasant set of tunes but none that will stay in your memory for long since the movie was, is and will be about Rajni's performance in the dual role. Everything and everyone else is critical but short lived gravy. This includes the leading lady who, as always, thinks she is acting if she rolls her eyes or flicks her brows here and there. For once I'd like Aishwarya to get rid of all the cosmetics and shallow attitude and play a role where she, well, performs! But I guess that's asking for too much. If she wants to play Barbie all the time that's her call. Fortunately, unlike 'Ravan', we don't have anyone else from her family to put up with in this one. So the harm done is minimal. Plus, Rajni's radiance is so bright here that no amount of glossy desktop wallpaper Photoshop effect can make one remember Aishwarya as the end credits roll.  Final word – go watch Endhiran. If there ever was an Indian movie that will be looked at as the perfect way to juxtapose today's ever changing technology against the carnal and still rather medieval human factor, Endhiran is that film. A movie that provokes you to answer the question – 'Technology is/was definitely ready for us all the time. But are we really ready for it?'  And as for Rajni? Well, he is just getting started. Endhiran will prove to be the movie where Rajni, much like his character Vaseegaran the scientist, ends up recreating himself in a whole new version (Version 2.0!). There is a lot more yet to come from this 60 year old teenager and I for one eagerly await it all. For actors may come and actors may go, But Rajni shall go on for ever."

A south Indian movie is capable of such cinematic excellence is really something. I watched this movie and it does not make you feel bored at any moment. This movie is perfect mix. A robot in his learning stage slowing getting to know the human kind and there goods and bads. Its as a good story line showing love is the most important thing in the whole world including to a Robot which falls for the beautiful Sana (Aishwarya). The movie resembled a little like I Robot but what the hell this is something different. In the final 30 minutes or so its the magic of Graphics showing 100s of Rajnikanth killing, smashing, destroying everything in the path.  All together 2 THUMBS UP Shankar. This movie is going to make wonders for Indian Cinema.... keep it coming."

        "title": "Endhiran- Come, Experience the \"Rajnitronics\"",
        "review": "Before we embark ourself into this review, we need to define the \"Law of 'Rajni'vity\".The Law of Rajnivity states that, when a movie with Rajnikanth as protagonist hits the theatres: 1) People get into a festive mood. 2) Rajni-mania grips the world. 3) Ticket-registers ring incessantly. 4) Entertainment is guaranteed. And Shankar's \"Enthiran – The Robot\" is no exception to the above axiom. But there are more things to Enthiran which not only guarantee entertainment, but also take us into a surreal world of 'Rajnitronics' and leave us bewitched.  The plot of Enthiran, scripted by late Sujatha and Shankar begins with Dr.Vaseegaran (Rajnikanth) who invents a Humanoid Robot (again Rajnikanth), which resembles him in appearance, voice and gait. He names it Chitti on his mother's request. Vaseegaran makes sure Chitti is highly proficient in all forms of art and well-versed in all languages, so that he can make Chitti serve the Indian Army. Meanwhile, Chitti who is unfamiliar with the outside world creates minor havocs with his innocent pranks. But the biggest challenge for Vaseegaran and Chitti is to pass the AIRD review headed by Vaseegaran's mentor Prof. Bora (Danny Denzongpa), who is envious about his pupil's rise to fame and wants to curb his progress at any cost. Vaseegaran tries to embed human feelings into Chitti. While things start to fall into place at the right time, his efforts backfire. Chitti falls in love with Vaseegaran's love interest Sana (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan). Infuriated by Chitti's misdeeds, Vaseegaran dismantles Chitti and dumps him into the garbage. Bora finds Chitti, reassembles him, and embeds a destructive \"Red-Chip\" into him. The deadly Chitti takes Sana as hostage and makes the AIRD building his fortress. A great \"WAR\" ensues. How Vaseegaran with the help of the Police and Army pacifies Chitti forms the rest of the plot.  Rajnikanth pulls off his dual role with utmost ease. His age-defying looks, on-screen charisma and scintillating style as Vaseegaran leaves the audience rendered speechless. Rajni instantly finds a place in your heart as Chitti. His robotic gimmicks, witty retorts and incisive one-liners leave you yearning for more and more of him. But what steals the show is his portrayal as the eccentric, wily and destructive Chitti. The transformation from a naive and obedient robot to a villainous and destructive robot has been exhibited well by the 'Superstar'. It reminds you of the vintage Rajnikanth of the 80s. A true legend he is. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan looks ravishing as the Superstar's lady love Sana. She comes up with a neat performance. Santhanam and Karunas, as Vaseegaran's assistants manage to tickle you with their funny encounters with Chitti. And Danny Denzongpa as the envious scientist fits into the role to a 'T'.  Director Shankar's penchant for grandeur, extravagance and flamboyant special effects has been evident in his previous ventures. But the mammoth scale CG and sets of Enthiran are truly beyond our levels of imagination. Hats off Shankar. Shankar has to be commended for devising a taut screenplay. Most part of the movie runs at a speed of 1 Tera Hertz, which apparently is the speed of Chitti! But a couple of song sequences are abrupt and look totally out of place. The astonishing special effects by Stan Winston Studios, and the gravity defying stunts by Peter Hein-Yuen Woo Ping duo prove to be a benchmark for Indian Cinema. Rathnavelu's photography blends well with the special effects. The scenes of the robot rampaging through Chennai's fly-overs have been captured fabulously by his lens. Sabu Cyril's lavish sets, picturization of songs, and the exotic locales are other USPs for the movie. Dialogues by Sujatha, Shankar and Karki are witty, sharp, and poignant. Sujatha's touch can be felt throughout the movie. The scenes where Chitti quotes from 'Thol Kappiyam', talks about human aspects such as betrayal, greed, and sacrifice, and his definition of 'God' are really moving. A lot has already been talked about A.R. Rahman's songs for Enthiran which are topping the charts till date. But Rahman's background score accompanied by some adept sound engineering by Resul Pookutty is another milestone for Indian Cinema. The Oscar duo's Symphony during the final moments of the movie and which continues into the credits is something which will be talked about for years to come.  Tamil audience have always dreamt of watching a Tamil speaking Super-hero who can fly, walk on walls, run faster than a train and take up different forms, and Shankar fulfils their dreams with the help of none other than the much revered Superstar Rajnikanth. Shankar exploits each and every facet of the legendary actor including his humor-sense, style, gimmicks and panache to give us some world-class entertainment. Producer Kalanithi Maran has to be appreciated for funding this magnificent venture which marks the entry of Tamil Cinema into the world stage. 'Enthiran' is a life-time experience. If you miss it, you are missing something in life! - Deepak Kumaar Manoharan"

        "review": "Out and Out Superstar's Extravaganza. Though People are confused about whether this is a Rajini movie or shankar movie ? I will say its 40-60(Rajini-Shankar). Though Die-hard rajini fans will for sure miss the Power packed rajini's action and punch dialogs but guess what? here you can find the good old rajini in a negative role and he again proves he is the best doing a negative role. CG is at its best in par with International standards. Aishwarya Rai the glamor doll has tried hard not be over shadowed by rajini. Dr.Vasi's(Rajini) brainchild Chitti the humanoid robo is all set to be dedicated to Indian army but before that the Evaluation panel from AIRD headed by the Villain needs to approve the Robo. But the villain turns down the approval With all evil intentions, the villain even tries to acquire the neural schema of Chitti. Unaware of this Dr. Vasi, embeds human emotion into chitti as a result of which Chitti falls for Sana (Aishwarya) Dr. Vasi's girl friend. And then the game starts. Though there are some lengthy sequence in the second half of the movie, the last 45 mins of the movie makes you forget everything. Special thanks to Writter Sujatha for his story and Dialogue."

        "review": "Story: robo Dr. Vasi is a scientist and he invents a robo who looks just like him. He names it as Chitti. Dr. Bora (Danny) is one of the key persons in robotics field in India and he disapproves Chitti since it could endanger the human lives. Dr. Vasi's girlfriend is Sana (Aishwarya Rai). She treas Vasi kindly. In order to make Chitti compliant to the norms set by Bhora, Dr. Vasi infuses feelings and emotions into Chitti. Chitti starts feeling like a human and he instantly falls in love with his creator's girlfriend. The rest of the story is all about what ensues between the creator and creation.  Artists Performance Rajnikanth can create magic as a human hero. Imagine what he could have done if he were a super-robo? The answer is 'Robo' movie. Rajnikanth played two roles of scientist and robot. There are two shades to Robot character - a law-abiding robot and a rogue robot. Rajnikanth changes his body language to suit the style and mannerism of robot in an extremely believable way. Rajnikant entertains you both as law-abiding robo and rogue robo. Director Shankar know how to exploit villainy from Rajnikanth without disturbing charisma and magic he possess. We end up loving the rogue Robo by the end of the movie. Rajnikanth justifies the budget of the movie and he is sure to get more than what the producer invested on the movie with his magic.  Aishwarya Rai: Aishwarya Rai defied age and marital status in this movie. She looks gorgeous and has got an important role in the movie. Her dances are definitely an asset to the movie. Watchout for her movements in 'Kilimanjaro' song shot in Peru.  Technical departments roboStory screenplay - direction: Shankar is a master commercial director and he makes sure that there are ample commercial elements and conflict points that would appeal to masses. Though Robo is a science fiction movie, Shankar scored the biggest brownie point when he pitted Rajnikant against Rajnikanth. Though it is a story of a relationship between man and machine, Shankar has beautifully showcased the human-side of the machine and mechanical side of the human. The screenplay of the movie is smooth and direction is near perfect. Shankar lets his imagination run wild during the last 30 minutes of the movie and it's spellbinding. Shankar's created Chitti character in such a way that it endearing to watch it's innocence. And you sympathize with Chitti even after it becomes rogue because Shankar has given enough justification for that. Robo is probably one of the very few Indians cinemas where villain is admired and adulated more than hero. The humor episodes of Chitti are rib-tickling. With Robo, Shankar proves that he is the best Indian film director in terms of grandeur, usage of technology and story telling.  roboOther departments: Music by AR Rahman is nice, but we expect a better music from a director of his reputation for a film of this stature. Background music is appropriate. Picturization of the songs is excellent Cinematography by Ratnavelu (Arya fame) is grand. Action sequences by Peter Heins and Yuen Woo Ping (Matrix and Kill Bill) are amazing. Visual effects and Robotronics by Stan Winston Studio (Avatar, Iron Man and Terminator) are outstanding. Art direction by Sabu Cyril is grand. Editing by Anthony is good.Production values by Sun Pictures banner are dazzling.  Here is the description of the songs -  1. Neelo Valapu: This song is canned on scientist and Aishwarya in a beautiful foreign locale. Since it's for the scientist character, there are not much of dance movements in the song. However the location and mood of the song is very good. Watching blue water body amidst arid desert is wonderful.  2. Inumulo Hrudayam: It is the first song in the second half. Shankar reserved the best three songs of the movie to the second half. This song comes when Robo expresses its love to the heroine.  3. Kilimanjaro: This song is shot in Peru against the backdrop of world-famous historic site Machu Picchu. The costumes, music, camera-work and Aishwarya Rai's dances movements make this song a special one.  4. Harima Harima: This is the best song of the movie in terms of picturization. Rajnikanth dances along with Aishwarya in his own empire consisting of Rajni-look-alike robo-sepians. Rajnikanth is amazing as he walks with a couple of chained electronic lions.  roboAnalysis: First half of the movie is good and interesting. Second half is excellent. The final 30 minutes of action sequences are mind-blowing. Shankar teams up with Rajnikanth to make this logic-defying entertainer that appeals to every movie lover around. The plus points are Shankar's story telling, Rajnikanth's charishma and extremely imaginative special effects/ animatronics. The flipside is that a few number of scenes are logic-less as it is supposed to be science fiction. Robo is the best special effects film ever made in India and is definitely India's answer to Hollywood in terms of both special effections and imagination. Go and watch it.  Tailpiece: I have recently seen the films 'I, Robot' and 'Bicentennial Man' again for the purpose of comparing with Robo movie. I find that 90% of the movie is original and imaginative and only 10% is inspired. One such striking inspiration is the dialogue from 'I, Robot' that goes like 'If humans do it, its called Homicide. If machine does it, its called accident'."

In Endhiran anything(Robot) can love. Artificial Intelligence will be artificial always. Rajini in Shankar's Movie. A.R. Rahman in Rajini movie and shankar's story.  !!!!! Shankar !!!!! Claps:  Well balanced screen play.  Took time to educate people about the technology, devices and how it will work with the input. o (E.g T.V. podu, Inspector saying vetittu po..)  Brought both the aspects, o How it will be if a robot doesn't have common sense and human feelings. o How it will be if the robot has common sense and human feelings. Both are well projected.  Pointed out how the solders life is always at risk and robot as a replacement for them.  The structural change (snake, ball etc) during the climax is intelligent. Each structure has its own power.  Itches:  Comedians are just to help the villain. (It's OK, Shankar does have a lot to say but the movie should end within couple of hour's right?)  A destructed robot reassembles itself, up to my knowledge it is not possible (Not sure how this can happen, Shankar might have a justification).  Few filmy and scientific errors (Always + or – % error is negligible).  The villain robot should have a different look (Personally felt).  !!!!! Rajini !!!!! Claps:  Perfect for the story.  Utilized the opportunity to perform both the positive and negative character.  Not sure whether any other hero (both in bollywood and kollywood) can do the negative role perfectly because the story demands a freak our negative character. Itches:  Rajini fans missed punch dialogs and stylish fights.  !!!!! A.R.Rahman !!!!!  Scored music, what is necessary for ranjini and story.  Background scoring is fine especially while the negative robot high jacking Aishwarya.  !!!!! Aishwarya Bachan !!!!!  Apt for the story to carry the attitude and elegance.  Well done during the climax scene.  !!!!! Technicians !!!!!  I regret to say that at the end of my show they have not projected the technician's name which will scroll at the end of the movie.  I salute people worked at the back ground Light man, Production executives etc."

        "review": "Hats off to Shankar, and ais costume's are wonderful, it's not a rajini movie its shanker movie, still ais is the most beatuful in the world.some about BW. With a bevy of machine guns in hand; all triggers locked, Superstar delivers a resounding punch line; 'Happy Diwali folks'. Yes, it was Diwali, minutes before the start of the first show here in Chennai with crackers going off in thousands, flowers flying around and people going delirious with excitement. This is Diwali; no matter even if the real one is still a month away, Superstar has arrived! Well, let us get down to the task. There is nothing much to reveal about the plot of Endhiran; one supposes. Thousands of speculations, predictions and of course, a mad frenzy about the trailer has given a rough idea about the plot. Endhiran is about Dr. Vaseegaran and Chitty, his creation- the robot with a 1 Zettabyte memory and a speed of 1 Terrabyte. From then on it is a 'Chitty showcase', of action, dance, emotions, fun and frolic. Watch Endhiran for the experience.  The foremost thing about any Superstar film is Superstar himself. He is the air the film breathes, right from the first frame. The biggest entertainer that India has produced, weaves magic on screen; even a nonchalant saunter on screen makes theatres erupt in celebration. Watching Endhiran one feels no doubt whatsoever that no one other than Rajnikanth could have pulled off this character. It is destiny that brought Endhiran to Superstar after travelling all through Kollywood and Bollywood. He delivers a tour de force performance – he owns the film. Be it as the workaholic scientist, the obedient Chitty or the destructive Chitty ('upgraded version – Chitty 2.0'), he scores; exuding brilliance and charisma in every frame. Yes, there are the trademark styles and mannerisms, but Rajnikanth transcends style and goes one better with Endhiran. His restraint while playing the scientist, the frustration that he shows while his scientific endeavours go wrong, underscore the fact that he is a brilliant actor who has been bogged down by commercial demands and compulsions. But, the focal point of the performance is definitely the robot. Chitty, the innocent child like robot is cute and lovable and dashing once romance starts flowing through his veins – wires. And, it is when the destroyer arrives that we see the Rajni in all his splendour. There seems to be absolutely no one who can come even close when playing a devilish destroyer. The outrageous and maniacal laugh as he proclaims his invincibility is a masterpiece – a throwback to the heydays of Rajnikanth the villain. The decades have not dimmed his brilliance and charisma one bit. And, the effort he has put into Endhiran shows in all frames; be it the fights or dance sequences; the desire to excel still burns bright. Aishwarya Rai looks ethereal as always. Though it is a bit difficult to still accept her as a college student, she delivers when it matters. Not the usual Shankar heroine (songs and dance only stuff) here, she is almost the fulcrum of the story.  Scripting wise, Endhiran does have its flaws, which is a bit disappointing. The first half is a smooth and jolly ride as the cute Chitty takes centre stage. A couple of fights set the tone for the fans to go overboard with excitement, a few lighter moment most of which are enjoyable and two songs make it a relatively light hearted affair. Shankar's ability to write commercial Tamil cinema elements (hero rescuing damsel in distress, witty one liners etc.) into a sci-fi script is commendable. That stops Endhiran from being a pure sci-fi flick, making it apt for all class audiences. Beginning of the second half is however not an apt extrapolation of the expectations raised in the first half. Though too much does not go wrong, there are portions which one feels could have been tighter. Some sequences, especially the 'Ranguski' part, are dragged along for more than a reasonable length. A couple of songs follow each other in quick succession which dampens things a bit. But, if you are willing to be patient through these minor glitches, the rest of the second half is racy, action packed and intelligent.  Action, as all might now, has been the talking point of Endhiran with world famous visual effects supervisors doing the job. The sequences have been conceived by Shankar (as shown in the titles) and do not lack in awe and magnificence. Be it on the train, on the truck or the highway – action is taken to a new plane in Endhiran. As expected, logic does fly out of the window now and then, but then, what is a Superstar film if there is no suspension of belief.  Hats off to Shankar for the vision and the effort! He has taken Tamil cinema to a new plane on technical terms, showing that nothing is impossible. The sets, effects, sound, style are all amazing and good enough to rub shoulders with Hollywood counterparts, give or take a few points. But, the basic story is still a desi love triangle! That is where Shankar has shown his skills; making state of the art film merge with our regional cinema tastes. His genuine desire to take Indian cinema to greater heights reflects throughout the movie. But, it is not just Shankar who has this vision, Superstar too shares it with him. The man whom we have known for total style and charisma has shown that he is game for something new that does not fit in to the conventional Superstar mould. Even after years of stardom he genuinely wants to bring in and be part of change that will take Indian cinema to higher levels.  Do Indian cinema a favour, watch Endhiran; let a 100 other Shankars feel bold enough to dream."

        "review": "Dr Vaseekaran (Rajni Kanth) makes a Robot and gives him his own shape. The Robot is omniscient and omnipotent. His motive is to prepare his Robot to join Indian Army. He wishes to make many more such Robots to help Army and reduce loss of lives during wars. But Dr Vaseekaran's enemy, another scientist (Danny) disproves that his Robot cannot fit to be used for military purposes as it cannot think like a human. He states that it has no emotions and reasoning capacity.  Dr Vaseekaran pumps in human feelings and reasoning capabilities and makes him almost a human. But things turn upside down. Robot starts loving Sana (Aishwarya Rai), the fiancée of Dr Vaseekaran. Robot gets attracted to Sana and that makes Vaseekaran angry. He destroys it.  But the enemy scientist takes the destroyed Robot, repairs it and infuses destructive mechanism in it. He wants it to sell to some international gangsters. But the love for Sana in Robot aggravates as wild possessiveness and that pesters Sana.  Robot becomes very strong physically and becomes like a cruel demon. It even kills the scientist who gives him second birth. It creates massive destruction to society by creating many Robots like itself.  How Dr Vaseekaran deactivates the Robot and brings things to peace is the end of the film.  Performances: Rajni Kanth is tremendously good at age 60. His moves, his gait and expressions didn't wane even a bit. He got connected to new age kids and they cannot forget him for rest of their lives. That way Rajni Kanth added another 60 years to his image.  Aishwarya Rai is the true asset for the movie. Her glamour made a lot of difference. As a true goddess of beauty she enchanted everyone.  Danny is apt in serious role. His performance is in contemporary international standards.  If there is anything to speak about the film, that's technical brilliance.  Music is in gen-next style. Sound is marvelous. Canning of songs is opulent. But the lyrics in Kilimanjaro are lewd and weak. Rest of the songs are fine.  Director Shankar deserves great mention for making this biggest feat possible on Indian screen with a message.  Analysis: \"It is selfishness that we must seek to eliminate. I find that whenever I have made a mistake in my life, it has always been because 'self' entered into the calculation. Where self has not been involved, my judgment had gone straight to the mark\"- Swamy Vivekananda  This saying of great soul of Indian soil lingers in the mind while watching this film. Knowingly or unknowingly Shankar made a movie basing on this saying.  It's a movie for world children.  Yes, it truly influences the senses of new generation kids those developed relation only with video games but not human beings. Hardly there are joint families now where grand parents teach morals to kids. And the kids tend to listen only to machine. They tend to follow what machine says. And director Shankar aptly takes the way through machine, the Robot, to teach values.  Kids run away listening to words kama, krotha, lobha, moha, mada, matsaryabut they assimilate that when shown in a dramatic way. That too, not in the style of Chandamama stories. They want something with scientific reasoning. Hence the path is chosen through 'Robot'.  How peaceful the Robo was and how useful that was to society when it's free from those 6 evils. And how it becomes detrimental to itself and society when injects them into it. That's aptly narrated.  The true essence of the movie is narrated in the end. The dialogues delivered by Robot while dismantling himself are hitting the hearts. The dialogues touch every human being with introspection. And at last, a girl looks back and goes with a thoughtful grimace. That is a symbolism for entire world kids those will be in thought process from now.  First half is entertaining. The first 30 minutes of second half are not gripping in right standards. That part is boring. But the climax action episode is marvelous to be on Indian screen. The last few closing dialogues are impressive and with true essence.  Hinduism or Islam or Christianity or Shintiosm or Taosimevery religion says one who is free from anger is the true strong man and one who shuns self is the true atman!!! 'Anger', as Sukhabodhananda says, is one letter less to danger. That is the true cause for destruction. Let us wish that this movie sows a seed at least in a few minds of children to prevent self entering into calculation while taking decisions.like a school girl that turns back and goes at the end on the screen..!!!!  Bottom-line: Watch it"

        "review": "This is a treat for everyone. Doesn't matter if u are a Rajni fan or not. Doesn't matter if u are a Tamilian or not. This movie is thoroughly enjoyable. This is like watching the effect of \"Pancha-bootham\" on screen. Rajni, Shankar, Arr, Aish and Sun pictures. Expected a masterpiece. Well i was not disappointed. If inception was a masterpiece then this is from our country. Looks so pleasing to see a non Bollywood movie taking the Indian graphics to a whole new level. Reaching this height will take few years. And not to forget this is Cochin Haneefa's last appearance in a Tamil movie (rip Haneefa. we miss u!).  Fist the story starts off with Rajni (not in an usual intro) fixing up his robot with Santhanam and Karunas as assistants. Robot gets created. Its basically like a child with no worldly sense. The robot makes few comedies which look silly but they are enjoyable. Rajni brings it to the notice of scientists but his guru (villain) is jealous. Villain rejects the robot authorization stating it has no feeling and its too vulnerable to external forces. So our scientist (Thalaivar) feeds in the feelings to it.  Its falls in love with Aish. So Rajni destroys it. Villain recreates it with massive destructive powers. The robot turns into a full time super-robotic villain. He creates a small army for itself. Then the story is how Hero Thalaivar rescues Aish from villain Thalaivar.  Well i could say this is an Indian version of Frankenstein (to an extent)!  The graphics used in the movie, mainly last 35 mins of second half is breathtaking. The formations of shapes by the robotic army were simply unimaginable for normal minds like ours! Sphere, rods, sheets were the first few to come. The snake and giant were the heights of imagination and graphics work.  Thalaivar, as usual, rocks and his presence is just enough to make the movie memorable. In the first few scenes Thalaivar with beard in the looks completely different. In villain sequencing one can notice the villain of 16 vaithinilae. Aish looks like a beautiful doll. After iruvar she has done a comment able job in Tamil cinemas. Samthanam, the human villain and karunas were OK and they fit their roles perfectly. Music and direction were as good as ever. Every time Arr + Shankar happens, a work which is universally appreciated in created. This is nothing less. Sun picture's marketing strategies are seriously great. Well Thalaivar needs no marketing! Suriyana pakarathuku torch thevaiya?  The only negatives are 1) I expected a lot form Santhanam especially after boss engira baskaran but his role is just passable. 2) Length of the movie is a bit too long. Ten minutes lesser would have been a better option. 3) And of course lack of Rajni masala. The lack of it affects a bit.  Which ever movie Srk refuses, it becomes a huge hit. Munna Bhai, 3 Idiots, etc. He has refused to do Endhiran too. Well this stands on top of the heap which were blockbusters and this is gonna bother the so called Badshah a lot. And for the \"art film loving\" maniacs. This is not for you. Don't dare go near theaters and say the movie is not good. Thalaivar fans treat Rajni as god. They will kill u, literally! The tickets rates are rocketing. Well its justified. Don't bother paying few extra bucks. U wont regret. Movie is too entertaining and remarkable. If u miss this in theaters then you have missed an Indian masterpiece. THALAIVAR ROCKS!!!! SUPERSTAR!!!!"

Endhiran guarantees super fun for the entire family and Rajinikanth re-establishes the fact that what no body can, only Rajini can! Climax is the mother of all Indian movie climaxes, where Rajni is King Kong, he is the Incredible Hulk, he is Iron Man, he is a Transformer, and he is the Anaconda. He is everything you have seen in special effects laden Hollywood flicks. Heck, in one scene, pinned to giant magnet with his arms stretched. BG music is little disappointing, Songs are great and shot at never ever seen locations. Overall this is an experience who family to get."

        "title": "How NOT to waste 300 bucks.",
        "review": "I did so. So, lets see how I can help you avoid it/ understand it. The fact that I'm writing a post(or rather doing a post-mortem, except that it was never alive!) on a movie for the first time, and choosing a movie like a Robo/Robot/Endhiran for the exercise will tell you two things: How cheated I'm feeling and how easy it is to dissect this pretentious sci-fi.By the end of it; actually from quite the beginning of it, my jaw dropped in disbelief at how I could possibly not have learnt a lesson from Shivaji and bring myself to this second show on the second day!  Let me begin. The movie is set in India present, where they manufacture humanoid robots like packets of potato chips! Mind you its not fantasy,everything else is same. The whole of first half, the whole bloody of it, is 'devoted' to the robo Chitti Babu( howzzat for a robo's name!) showcasing his skills, i.e his super-human abilities which even super-heroes should envy. He's omnipotent!! We get it! Why repetitively show he can do this, do that, pluck out his head, save people, cook, (crack crappy jokes with two idiots intermittently), dance, fight Rajni style ;) , defy every god-damn force in nature, show off his omniscience, and why, he can even deliver babies! Why all this trouble when you could've just said he was Rajni a.k.a God. Actually, that would've at least been sincere. This was well, lame.  The second half to which people attribute all its glory( of course, I was hopeless by then.) is about the robo getting emotions first,.. Wait! This is interesting! God said \"Let there be lightning\" and the robo gets emotions! So, now he's Rajni now in totality! (Oh, yeah. he lacks that \"male-thing\" Rajni has- Coming right from the movie.howzzat!) Anyways, there are two Rajnis now, but its a contradiction: GOD is one. So, one Rajni, the scientist hacks the other to death and dumps him in a garbage. But you see the contradiction again, Rajni and death? No way! Hence the resurrection, but wait for it.. this time he's Chitti Babu 2.0 with a red evil card inserted. So, he's Satan. Now, God and Satan; that's possible. Now, Satan's skills are showcased in the later half. Aha! The 'special effects'! Whats with people and special effects?! Would they sacrifice everything in a movie for them? Apparently Yes. The whole effects team,as you can see in the credits,are roped in from Hollywood and still we're proud to claim that \"this movie is India's answer to Hollywood\". Seriously, what's 'Indian' in this? Had Hollywood watched this, they'd probably laughed their guts out. I? I can only cry. If there ever is an Indian answer to Hollywood, that should be screen-writing. And for this, a 'prodigy' like Shankar writes worse than a 10-year old. And the same kid can reverse engineer the whole movie. There's no motivation, there's no conflict point. I bid goodbye to my image of the stud Shankar. Seemingly, he's no exception to the crusade of visual effects. And to expect from him a poor, dark, vulgar joke on menstruation ?? Well, that was the End.  Dear God, I'll be a theist for this sentence and the next. Save us poor souls from this \"God\". Dot."

        "title": "The Greatest Movie of all time (at least 25 Stars out of 10)",
        "review": "Note: If you read my review, please vote so that I know if you found my review helpful (or not, for that matter). Thanks.  This movie has Rajnikanth - this statement alone should suffice, but for the sake of humanity, I will try to elaborate.  Many years from now, if the World is destroyed by Nucular Holocaust, Global Warning or some such calamity, and then an Alien ship lands on Earth, and them Aliens get to watch Endhiran (most probably on Blu-Ray with surround sound), they will regret not reaching the Earth earlier. They will also have to accept the fact that they could never reach the level of mankind. After watching this movie, they would laugh if someone told them that Marlon Brando and Lawrence Olivier were probably some of the best actors.  This movie proves that Tamil movie industry is million miles -- no light years -- ahead of Hollywood movie industry. If you just read the end credits, you will know that my statement is true. Never has Hollywood been able to have so many Indian names in their credits, whereas this movie alone has screens full of Hollywood CGI guys. If this trend is continued, after sometime Hollywood will have no technicians to work with, and have to give up movie-making altogether.  Some jealous people have mentioned that this movie is a copy of Bicentennial Man, which is an outright lie. Endhiran is absolutely, fundamentally different from Bicentennial Man: For example, the scientist in Bicentennial Man does not wear glasses; also the robot there is not called Chitti Babu!  For those others, who say that Endhiran has borrowed from I, Robot and Transformers etc., I say only two words: CIA Conspiracy (Oops, I so sound like Kevin Trudeau!). I strongly believe that CIA used some covert technique, such as staring at goats, to extract the thought-waves of Shankar (as he claimed, he has been planning for this movie for the past 10 years) and then has given those ideas to Hollywood movie makers to diminish Indian (read Tamil) achievement.  One of the greatest scenes in this movie involves the Robot and a bunch of mosquitoes. Even when Hollywood makes a movie entitled \"Dances with Wolves\" there is no Wolves dancing in the movie, and that alone shows, how far ahead the Tamil film industry in comparison to Hollywood is!  Some reviewers have stated that this movie would win all the Oscar awards; one has also mentioned Cannes. Since movies such as, Terminator, Godzilla, I, Robot, Transformers and others -- all of which are made based on concepts stolen from parts of Endhiran, by a method I mentioned earlier (hint: CIA was involved) -- have won so many Oscar and Cannes awards, Endhiran is bound to surpass them all by winning in all categories at the Oscars and Cannes.  Negative points: The only negative point of this movie is its short length. This movie should have been at least 6 hours long for detailed character development and other aspects. If simple movies such as Once Upon a Time in America, which neither had songs nor CGI, could be 4 hours long, Endhiran, the greatest movie ever made, surely should have been at least 6 hours long!  On second thought, I also think that the number of songs is too less for such an epic movie with the \"Honorable Thalaivar\" (sorry if the spellings are wrong; I learned this phrase here at IMDb only today) Superstar, Dr. Rajnikanth.  Note: If any of you would like to say something personally to me, you may please write to pinchashodi at yahoo com. Thanks."

        "review": "I went with great expectations to see the most awaited movie in India. This movie is an adaption from the novel written by the late writer Sujatha. Its been a dream for Shankar to bring this story into reality.  Introduction scene of Rajnikanth - I have seen almost all Rajni's films till now he has acted. From the 90's till now at least i would say, his introduction scene is one among the most anticipated scene for all his die hard fans. Boy what an intro scene in this movie - turning his back and not attending a phone call - cud have been better The main message behind the story was how by harnessing technology in all fields, we could save lives of people. Very good idea and nicely told. The concept of Man and Machine and its conflict with right and wrong is told neatly.  Introduction of Chitti the Robot - Did the director wanted the robot to appear so artificial, or was that the best effort by the graphical and makeup team i cant guess. It leaves the viewer in 2 minds. Thrilling 1st half i would say the movie was.  Aishwarya - Man she looks old and out of shape, but just to suit Rajnikanth.  the 2nd half of the movie is too lenghty and too boring. Many logical points have been missed in the 2nd half. Songs come now and then and do not synchronise too well with the movie. Music could have been better and doesn't feel like ARR's.  The last 30 mins of the movie is where the money has been spent on. Graphics is OK and the idea behind to project the robots in a draconian way shud be appreciated. My 9 yr old nephew sitting next to me got scared looking at the monstrous giant robots resembling anaconda.  This is a film centered around the story and would be a letdown for a normal film viewer and goes too well with rajni fans only. The heart and soul of the movie is CHITTI the ROBOT. Watch it without great expectations and ur in for a treat.  The after effects of releasing the movie is that every 15 mins i see the movie advert and all sorts of people appreciating the movie on Sun TV. The viewers of Sun TV have to live with this torture for at least another 6 months and the functions to follow."

        "review": "Rajini was impressive. Ash looked good. The last 40 minutes were excellent. It was a tough movie, and the co-ordination of the team is very appreciated.  The movie lacks an intense screenplay.. the concept was indeed good but not interwoven tightly and the story line is thin.. The first half was a bit dragging.. The movie would have been crisp at 2 hours. Next, I was not convinced how Rajini teaches the robot feelings!!! In the second half, science fiction turns to fantasy :).. Now, coming to the budget, it is justified but intriguing screenplay does not need money, just brain...  Again, the way tamil cinema works have to change for such projects.. I understand this is way tooo much to handle for Shankar. A team of specialists to draft the screenplay would have perfected it.  One thing I felt is.. Rajini is so goddamn amazing in negative shades. I feel he would make The Best villain in the histories of cinema. The sarcasm ,the style wah wah wah... This is where is he really shows his acting prowess. I know it is impossible for such pleasure in tamil cinema given his fans.. But very modest as a hero.  The CG or the animatronics.. Good. But it was like taking the tamil audiences to a tour of CG like wat they did in old MGR movies abroad showing the city around, like wat they did in Appachan 3D movie, showing the balloon and the ice cream to your face, etc.. The script didn't require so much!!  Ppl.. Don't please say 'According to Tamil standards, blah blah.. I watch movie to my standard and you watch it to your standards. Wat do you really know about others? I think Tamilians have grown a lottt from the typical 80's. This is time we demand more. Not budget, but brain. Directors.. don't restrict yourself considering commercial success!!! Surprise us.. Give us ur best!! We will acknowledge it.."

        "review": "Now then Enthiran has been screened world wide leaving lot of scope for acclaims and columns.Rajni being the crux of all discussions pre and post movie,now u really got to see how far the movie has stood to one's expectations. 1.It s certainly a new recipe in the same vessel.creativity stands out and though it reminds u certain Hollywood movies(small-soldiers,terminator),its definitely a visual treat for those who have not regular with English movies. 2.The captive thing in this movie is the characterization of the robot...especially the destructive one.Aishwarya is all charm and yeah she has exposed well....her acting skills.Most part of the movie revolve around vasee,chitty and sana and other actors hardly find a place to mention but then the villain scores cheeky singles at crucial times. 3.Songs are definitely a visual treat as usual and arima song needs special mention.Re-recording and the sound track are definitely gonna claim almost every acclaim and that is why A.R.Rahman is considered to be the best in the business & not to forget Rasul pookutty's hand in the sounds. 4.Lot of scientific mentions(Fibonacci nos,normal delivery of a critical baby) are surely encouraging.It demands the common man to get to know more about the imaginary world of science. 5.The train fight,hospital seen and the climax fight have been pictured so well. Robo rajni stand tall in every frame. 6.Being it love,anger,hesitation,frustration and comic....the super-star scores 100%.He has surely carried the script on his shoulders expecting no room for his usual style,punches and fights.(he escapes from a rogue frightened...believe me) 7.The movie has its own flaws too.Santhanam and karunas are certainly a big let down in the movie. 8.Technically sound but too many logic hindrances.In the climax amidst the war we could hardly see any public...when was Chennai vacant to make that shot? 9.But then the movie keeps u well stuck in Ur seats and as a part of our duty,encouraging such films becomes necessary to boost the brilliance of Shankar and to encourage other such directors.This movie is certainly gonna set a new trend in the market as well. Special mention about a scene where the Robo finds Vasee in its tertiary is an excellent work.Its completely a shankar movie leaving Rajni enough space to expose his villainy looks and acting skills as well not to forget Kalanithi maran's big hand to make this big movie possible. Endhiran-Vaseegaran...surely inspires Rating:7/10"

The director sort the same old formula of exhibiting senseless stunts, unwanted comedy tracks to make fans happy, but non rajni and a.r.rah man fans cannot digest few scenes . visual effects were a treat(only at the end of second part) . one of the best animation studio has worked for the movie and as expected graphics look good as never before in Indian cinema , but the problem comes with directors 'IMAGINATION' . Most of things shown are not practical and carry no logic but only carry the film forward sufficient to bring back viewers to theaters. Due to the hype created, it may set new records on it's name, but cannot be counted as the best movie from \"INDIA\""

        "title": "Nothing New. Well one can say this is a stepping stone for Indian cinema and Kudos to shankar for that",
        "review": "Finally, I got the time to write a review for Endhiran. To start with, this is a good attempt. Highest budget in the Indian film history and it is for a science-fiction genre. The best technicians in the world, the best talent support on-screen, and a derived story from an acclaimed tamil novel. What can go wrong here? Absolutely nothing! But for me it was otherwise. Everything went haywire! The foundation-setting for the movie is done brilliantly and the impression it sets is really good. Rajnikanth has done a brilliant job with Robo-Chitti (Good Robo) but there is nothing to write home about here. Though Aishwarya forms the crux of the movie there is nothing much for her to do other than to don some designer clothing and do some little acting. The problem starts with the second half, when the action starts and things look just like a page out of any tamil movie. Except for here that this was touted to be a mega-project and some scenes lack the quality that was expected. And one gets to see Rajni in his vintage-glory during the black-sheep segment. If some of the action sequences in the second could have been trimmed, things would have been better for the movie. While the movie claims to be derived from a tamil novel, a robot story will always have many things in common. And it is not different here. The story seems to be a mix of A.I, i-Robot, Terminator and The Matrix. This is just a movie meant for entertainment and nothing more. Nothing ground-breaking here. It is Rajni all the way. Even if you hate the guy, you can give this a try."

        "review": "This is the greatest treat for Rajinikanth's fans. I watched the movie at Cochin. Most of the theaters were running the film and a huge crowd to watch it.  Android concepts have not been a subject of Indian films as they may not be understandable to the common masses. But this film has depicted the concept in a very simple yet in a good fashion.  Though the story line seems to be quite common, the acting of superstar in his dual role as an android and the scientist both done in a beautiful manner.  Beauty queen Aiswarya rai has also done her role quite well.  This movie will become the stepping stone to many movies in the same genre which may come in future.  I liked the last few scenes very much in this movie because of the creativity and originality in the stunt scenes in which the androids take the shape of a sphere, cylinder, and most interesting and awesome was the form of a cobra. It is definitely creative...very good.  The message however was very disheartening to see that in conclusion any advent in science & technology is termed to dangerous and hostile and it should be quarantined. In the movie, They still keep the android in a museum even after completion of 20 years. The message could have been a little different though stating that the advent of technology is good."

        "title": "A Magnum Opus",
        "review": "Watched Endhiran for the second time today. Really amazed by the totality of the movie. This is what we say a \"Magnum Opus\", the father of all Indian movies. The biggest Extravaganza in Indian cinema. ROBOT – A Man, A Machine & His Mohobbat.  The highlight of the movie is the Special Effects and the magnificent acting performance by the one and only one 'SUPERSTAR' on earth, Rajinikanth. This movie is all about 'SUPERSTAR' Rajinikanth V/S 'SUPERHERO' Robot-kanth.  Dr.Rajinikanth's fans went to watch the movie to see their Superstar once again in the silver screen. But actually what was waiting for them? It was not a single Rajinikanth.. it is more.. even more.. more than a thousand Rajinikanths. Sounds Crazy?? Ah?? Actually it's not a crazy thing. It is a real feast to all the Rajini fans.  It is really an appreciable attempt by director Shankar. We can see a Shankar touch in many areas of the movie. Shankar really managed to bring the special effects to this movie in a well efficient manner. We know he is very well fond of implementing Computer Graphics in his movies. We can see some SFX even in his old movies like Gentleman.  The Art Direction is excellent. So is the background score. I really appreciate the efforts of Sabu Cyril for his amazing set designing & the Oscar winner Resul Pookutty for his fabulous Sound designing. Cinematography is one of the plus point, that the movie can proud of. The Song picturization is awesome! The first half suits for every kind of people. It filled with comedy, love, fight,.. etc. While in the second half, the movie takes the audience to the serious episodes of the story and then to the best special effects scenes that you'll be never experienced in any of the Indian movies. I am pretty sure that you will be amazed by the perfection of each and every graphics in the movie. The transformation parts are awesome! The main drawback I found was: we can see many instances that can be developed into some sentimental scenes. For example: The scene when Robot-kanth kidnaps Aiswarya Rai during her marriage function and kicks hero Rajinikanth into the sky – it really lacks some feeling. The audience doesn't feel any sadness thinking of their hero - Rajinikanth's mental state - who just lost his fiancée!! The climax scene is also missing some feelings. I saw people in the silver screen, crying in the climax. But that feeling didn't reach to the audience. The other drawback is the songs. Only 2 songs are good to the ears. ARR is not at his best in this film.  Here, the hero Rajinikanth is really a blooper version of himself (The Superstar). We cannot imagine a Rajinikanth movie where he cannot fight. But in Endhiran, the scientist hero Rajinikanth is not a fighter. He is even afraid to slap Kalabhavan Mani's character. This is really a new experience for the Rajini fans and I hope they enjoyed it.  The Mosquito scene got mixed reviews. What I have to say is, it is a Robot movie. So nothing is impossible. Its really a funny scene. I laughed like anything when I heard one mosquito's dialogue that, they are going for a petition for considering them as the National bird of India! Aisawarya's performance is good. Her dance steps are beautiful. Actually the beauty queen got dominated by the amazing acting performance by the superstar. Rajinikanth again proved that there is no one to stand against him. The lead role was safe in the hands of the 'Style King' Rajinikanth and no one can ever imagine another actor in this role.  Obviously Endhiran is a movie that Indian cinema can always be proud of. The Special effects scenes are perfect and a real threat to the Hollywood. I heard some people saying that, Robot is the best Indian film in it's genre (Science Fiction). But I would say it is the best Indian Entertainer ever happened! This movie just proved that even Indians can make movies which threats Hollywood in the technical perfection."

Robot's story isn't much of a puzzle. Vaseegaran has built a robot with the sole aim of donating the technology to the Indian army so it can use robots on its battlefields and prevent thousands of soldiers from dying. Thus is born Chitti, who, as described above, is peerlessness personified (Rajini, by the way, doesn't really do much; all his stunts and capers are computer graphics).  However, when Vaseegaran coaches him to start having feelings, all hell starts breaking loose. Chitti has started becoming a man, and no man can resist a woman who looks like Aishwarya Rai and keeps kissing him on his cheek and telling him how amazing he is - even if the woman is the boss' girl.  The first half of the movie consists of fun and emotions of the kind that you saw in Small Wonder, and a lot of the phony-yet-glitzy romance that commercial cinema usually has."

        "title": "Cant Describe in Words.... !!!!",
        "review": "I am a person who watches selective Telugu movies (Saw this in Telugu), wanted to see this movie since its inception and after I saw Sivaji 3 years back, I was awe struck by Super Star \"RAJNI's\" acting skills and his persona... He was just awesome in Sivaji....  Shankar, one of the finest directors in Indian Cinema and he will be regarded as one of the best directors who has redefined Indian Cinema with his every movie, be it Sivaji or Boys or Anniyan or Bharateeyudu, he has given a new definition to a Blockbuster in each of his movies and he has mesmerized the audience every time when he makes a movie, In this he has cone something which cannot be expressed in words and the space wouldn't be enough for me to describe his persona and his directing skills....He has taken out the best performances from each and every department and each and every actor, the best part of the movie was the part where Chitti accepts all his mistakes in the court and Vasi just agrees to dismantle his years of hard work...  Rajni Sir.... What should I say about this SUPERSTAR who at this age acted in such a simple manner that I have become his ultimate fan and would love to see his movies...His laugh for the Evil Robo is awesome and his negative role is the best part of the movie, At this age he was so wonderful that I cant express it in words, His acting, his dialogues and his Personality was oozing such a wonderful persona of the Super Star that I wont be able to express it here, His comic timing was awesome, his action was impeccable.... Hats off RAJNI SIR...UR THE REAL SUPERSTAR and U ROCK........  Aishwarya...I thought Ash paring with Rajni Sir would be awkward but it was no where awkward and she complemented Rajni in every scene with co much confidence and her own persona that not even a single scene looked awkward, her styling by Manish Malhotra was just awesome, she looked very beautiful in this movie after Jodha Akbar (I felt so)...Just look at her styling in songs especially Kilimanjaro and Kadahl Annukan it just leaves you speechless....  AR Rahman..The Academy Award Winner, has given one of the best Music and Backgraound score of his career, he has silenced his credits with this after Puli a debacle...Robo redefines Rehman...all the singers has complemented him with their best work, Kilimanjaro is the best of all the songs visually as well as composition wise....  Special Effects...The best ever in the history of Indian Cinema and you would just be awestruck looking at them, last 20 minutes of the movie just shocks you.... not even a single scene looks like its going over the top...  A humble request to all Bollywood Directors, come out of your comfort zones and think out of the box...Bollywood cant make such movies, they can make Krissh (No Logic)or Koi Mil Gaya (Direct Lift of ET)...take a lesson from the directors of south, they are the ones to look out for...Grow Up Bollywood....  Please do yourself w favor, don't watch this on a Pirated CD or Online, watch it in a Theater.....  My Ratings...Story - 10/10..... Performances - 10/10.... Direction - 10/10.... Music - 10/10... Overall - 10/10"

        "title": "A different try with Rajnikanth",
        "review": "I was listening to the audio of this movie from the day it got released, AR.Rahman has done a good job in doing the music part, he scores 9/10, when i first went to this movie with a lot of expectations it turned out pretty well but i was expecting like the ones Shankar made such as Anniyan, Mudhalvan etc., as far in this movie, the first half really rocked that it went interesting and funny and keeps you occupied with the moving story, the songs in film were totally unique, mostly other than 2 songs in the film other songs were staged which it did not surprise me but i totally loved Aishwariya rai's dancing, she was incredible and looked stunning throughout the movie, The fights scenes were incredible that appeared in the train which i loved it because it gave the awe the superstar feeling :),comedians Santhanam and the other were not that useful in the film but though they played their parts quite well, the story is unique but somewhat not a powerful one, where in the movie the characters are the powers than the story and the main thing is that rajni kanth has been given importance to the character than his punch dialogues and his style, the second half is where the film quite slowed down a bit due to the songs and too much of visual graphics, it is a tremendous effort on using such effects for the first time in a tamil film but i think it could have been used wisely but it was terrific anyway, there are many good scenes in the film, there is a scene in the movie where Rajnikanth says \"Happy Diwali Folks\" that gets you a smile on your face or make you say it to yourself, well i would say overall it is a Good movie, watch it for your favorite stars and for the high budget and for Shankar. 7/10 Verdict: Recommended"

        "title": "India's First Sci-Fi Robo Thriller",
        "review": "Wonderful director, Good Music, Excellent Robo living by Rajini:  Genius scientist Dr. Vaseegaran (Rajni) creates India's first \"andro-humanoid\" robot and nicknames it Chitti. As robots go, Chitti is simply perfect and can do everything from cook complicated cuisines to absorb thick volumes of medical books to beat up several baddies in one go. In short, much like Rajni himself.  His 10 years of research has consumed his total time, so naturally, his personal life has taken a beating. Enter the breathtakingly beautiful medical student Sana (Aishwarya Rai), his fiancée. She's all pout and sulk because Vasee's work has taken him away from her so much. Their true love is the only thing that keeps cooling Sana's anger and their relationship is one of quarrel, then kiss and make up. Literally.  Vasee's aim in making Chitti is not for millions of dollars of personal gain, but to have Chitti accepted as a possible substitute for human life in the Indian army. Dr. Bohra is the head of A.I.R.D. that must give approvals to such inventions and he is insanely envious that he, as Vasee's professor, has not been able to achieve something as momentous as Vasee's Chitti. Thus he does not approve of Chitti for the armed forces.  Twists and turns happen. Chitti remains an amazing companion to Vasee and a super skilled being for as long as his \"neural schema\" is not captured and corrupted. Of course, all does not go well, and in an attempt to instill human feelings and emotions inside Chitti, Vasee forgets the possible repercussions of a thinking and emoting robot and that's when the trouble begins. Suddenly, Chitti develops \"feelings\" for Sana. For a while, there is humor in this supposedly mock competition between the creator and his being until it becomes serious and Vasee has to terminate Chitti. Suddenly, Chitti rises like a phoenix and gets Bohra's help to get resurrected, after which Chitti is his own army (literally), so mayhem and destruction follow. Vasee has to use all his powers of science and logic to thwart Chitti and finally, we wait to see whether evil robotics have taken over the world or if Vasee ha managed to once again control his creation.  Points to ponder:    Verdict:  First of it's kind for Indian audience. It's a sci-fi romance thriller. True Rajni fan or not, movie is amazing. If you haven't already flocked to the theater's to buy a ticket for this movie we guess you should be dismantled.  Dot."

        "title": "Superstardom redefined",
        "review": "\"When a team outgrows individual performance and learns team confidence, excellence becomes a reality and success takes care of itself\". Endhiran is an practical proof for the above hypothesis. Endhiran is a product of the synergism of the big guns like Rajnikanth, Shankar, A.R.Rehman, Aiswarya Rai, Kalanidhi Maran, Peter Hein, Resul Pookutty and many more. This obviously means that Endhiran is going to be an undisputed asset in the history of Tamil cinema.  Confronting reality, Director Shankar did say that Endhiran was his dream project and wrote the script for Kamal Hassan. Due to some dramatic turn around of events, Rajni was signed to play the lead role in the movie. This may be a probable reason why Endhiran does not look like an usual Rajni movie. But hats off to director Shankar as he has adopted the storyline and screenplay very well according to the status and abilities of Rajnikanth. Rajnikanth has also given his best to the role and has silenced his critics who often criticize him for his lack of variety and flavor in his movies.  The major drawback of this movie is the lack of a proper sci-fi storyline. People will surely be disappointed with the most bizarre entry scene for Rajnikanth. The first half of the movie is pretty slow with a very bleak theme. In the second half, the storyline virtually stops after the entry of Rajni in villain role and the movie fully revolves and ends around Rajni with scintillating visual effects.  Aiswarya Rai is alluring even at the age of 37 and is probably the oldest pair for Rajnikanth in recent times. Danny Denzongpa sets up some expectation in the first half of the movie but his sudden disappearance in the second half was really unexpected. Santhanam and Karunas have tried their level best to perform their roles but Shankar has miserably failed to tap the full potential out of them. But these performances were shadowed by the performance of Rajnikanth throughout the movie. That too none can deny the fact that in the last 45 minutes of the movie, the entire cast of the movie was Rajni, Rajni and Rajni alone.  We should really pay our salutations for A.R. Rehman for coming up with fascinating music and background score. The usage of nearly 130 talented musicians for a single movie in India is plausibly the first time in history. But it is too sad to say that the visuals for the songs were not that impressive except 'Kadhal Anukkal' song. We almost get a feeling that 3 songs were shot with a similar choreography inside different studios with different costumes.  Talking about the producer Kalanidhi Maran, we must really appreciate him for taking such a costly step in cinema investment. But I am sure he wont regret his decision as he will reap good yields from this investment. To put it simply, \" Paradise lost will be several times regained\".  Summing it all up Endhiran marks the beginning of a new era of Tamil cinema with Rajni adding a new dimension for his Superstardom. The high ticket rates and the demand among people to get a single ticket shows the total worth of this movie. Endhiran is a trend-setter....."

        "review": "New Generation who knows about Rajini is as a actor of style.Shankar extracted the other face i.e the acting skills of rajinikanth to the world using this movie. No other actor from India other than rajni can't bare the weight of the script. Positive aspect is the comical touch through out the first half with attractive dialogues. Even though it involves lot of technical info, the novice viewers can really understand the concept through scenes. The power packed action sequence in train will attracts all the audience Aishwariya has the pivot role in the film but overshadowed by Rajni's Awesome Performance in the three different character.  Second half is bit lengthy and utilized the full power of stanwilson studio. CWG is extraordinary and a new concept. Though it resembles some earlier Robot films (its Unavoidable) the way action sequenced picturized and the plot shows its uniqueness.Full credit goes to SHankar.  Negative aspects: 1. No Style mannerism as special from Rajini as Hero (Die Hard fan expectation) 2.Length of second Half"

        "title": "My movie- Robo.",
        "review": "I watched Robo today in I-Max. Touted as one of the most expensive movies ever made and boasting a lethal combination of the biggest mass hero of India and a top-most commercial & visionary director, Robo has been the most awaited movie of the year.  The only hero in the entire Indian film industry who can be ordained the tag of a SUPER HERO without any additional attire (like superman or batman) is none other than SUPERSTAR RAJNIKANTH. At the age of 60, this man's chutzpah and appeal remains inconceivable. I don't mind being referred to as a low class movie fan but if a director shows Rajnikanth stopping a train or a flight with his bare hands, I will believe it without any argument. This adulation is probably because of my excessive bias towards the Superstar who came from a very poor background and emerged into one of the most popular film actors of India ever.  However Robo is not a Rajnikanth movie. This is a movie where the director's vision dominates the hero image. The aura of invincibility and supreme power associated with Rajnikanth is missing. However, the director very skillfully transferred those powers to the Robo character (played by Rajnikanth). The first half of the movie is good. The pace goes down in the second half and comes back to track during the last half hour. The biggest letdown is music. I don't know if it was just me but for some reason, I felt the interlude placement was irregular and I observed this pattern in 3 songs. The re-recording was not catchy as well. The art and graphic work (especially in the second half) is top class.  Robo is worth a watch for the directorial vision. It will be a good treat for kids. It is a great privilege to see India's most popular superstar allowing a director's vision overshadow his unconquerable image. I hope our Telugu heroes (especially youngsters) follow the footsteps of the Superstar in this regard.  Tailpiece: During mid-nineties, Star Plus telecast a sitcom titled Small Wonder. The series is about a robotics engineer (named Ted Lawson) who builds a robot modeled after a real human girl and passes it off as his daughter. As the series progresses, the robot, which is named as Vici/Vicki (played brilliantly by Tiffany Brissette), begins to display human emotions and becomes an inseparable and integral part of the Lawson family. In some episodes, the robot behaves snobbishly and is \"shut down\" and restored to a more harmless version by its inventor. As a teen and totally in awe of American lifestyle, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. One of the first things I did after coming to America was attempting to contact the stars of the show and I did succeed getting an email response from Emily Schulman who played the role of Harriet Brindle in the series.  I was reminded of Small Wonder episodes at least on 5/6 occasions while watching this movie. The Robo character scanning through the book and cramming its entire contents, turning its head 360 degrees, attracting guns/weapons through magnetic power and taking orders literally are some of the similar acts that I noticed in the above series. I also found similarities to Frankenstein movie.  A good director is necessarily a good observer. In one of his early interviews, Shankar mentioned that he makes it a point to watch Hollywood films and TV shows to derive ideas for story development. I will not be surprised if Small Wonder was one such TV show that enjoyed this illustrious film maker's patronage. A great lesson to every wannabe film director is to keep their eyes and ears open. Be perceptive to every thing you see, every individual you meet – big or small. You never know what an itty-bitty thing could turn into!"

        "review": "Rajnikanth has outshone all his previous films with this one. For all Rajini fans and the ones who are not, this movie is MUST WATCH. Amazing action sequences, plot, music and above all -India's superstar at one of his best roles of his lifetime. Playing 3 different shades in Endhiran and essaying each one of them with ease makes Rajnikanth who he is.  If there is one star who can outdo Aishwarya Rai - it has to be this actor and only him! Lot of thought has gone into making the technical aspects of this film. A.R Rahman music is slow to catch on but after watching the movie, it is actually not bad.  I am impressed with this film for it's content and entertainment value. You really do come away with an experience. Rajnikanth has a cult status in India and there is a reason why people worship him. You cannot imagine any other actor doing this role. His power and enigma just seeps through every frame. He has set himself now a standard which I hope he can break it another time. A tough task indeed.  Absolutely worth watching over and over again!"

        "review": "There are occurrences in the movie, some of which are brilliant and others on the other hand are too much to handle. Let us discuss each one by one.  I liked how robot produced data on the go. The robot while its first inspection gave answers to the jury of its questions over vast range of topic.  However due to lack of following Asimov's rules turns out to be dangerous and get rejected.  Instead of changing code the scientist who built the robot tries to embed emotions into a machine. For me it is too much to handle. He is successful; I accept it only because of lightening factor.  A robot talking to mosquitoes was another factor that was too much to handle.  The pregnancy shot filmed was again brilliant. People can associate with it more because such a thing is very common.  The end to free people from corrupt robot was tedious. I am not among the audience which liked the dragging end with the graphics which were unnecessary (and not up to mark). Here movie loses a point.  Final Verdict: I liked it for the positives discussed above. I feel general audience will enjoy it."

Technologically this is one of the best films. It does have some routine romantic scenes(afterall a tamil film) but yet the main story of Rajnikant making a clone of himself is terrific when the clone does a volte face it strikes you, there are several scenes well handled in the second half like Cheethi recognising the real Rajnikant, Danny's death and the climax which goes a bit overboard but superbly handled  Director Shankar does a terrific job Music is decent  Rajnikant handles both the roles perfectly, his make up is simply terrific hard to make out it's a 60+ person playing the part Aishwarya Rai is decent in her role Danny is good but his role is half baked, rest are okay"

        "title": "Wild Ambition !",
        "review": "Everything in this Tamil movie says how ambitious and industrious its makers were. Clear that they wanted to make something so away from ordinary or familiar. And they did it big time, with nearly all the right factors. Just count with me..  The insane budget; it's really rare to watch an Indian movie which has something else singing, dancing, romance or comedy and had that amount of money. Some sites say that the budget was US$23 million, and others say US$40 million. But both ways I salute that practical believing in 1) something else the usual goods of Bollywood, 2) Sci-Fi.  The meticulous, smart and hot writing. Apparently, and compared to the majority of the Indian production, there was some hard work behind that script. The events are done with logic, the imagination is fresh, and the thrill is well made. It even manages to win a substance too, since it shows that perfection is scary, and conscience is hard to program in a machine, but not evil.  The excellent performance of (Rajinikanth), being the ideal that every movie star, rather every man, looks for while being a 60 years old (I think it's impossible for some to believe that he was at that age while shooting !). In his dual role, he delivered such a sedate performance, which amazed even no fan of him like me. And if you're accustomed to his body image in his previous movies, you'll know how he went to great lengths to look that lissome !  The mesmerizing directing. Director (Shankar) made an extraordinary cinematic fun which outclasses many many American sci-fi action movies. Enough to say that during the viewing I kept telling myself \"This is where Bollywood says to Hollywood : Be afraid. Be very afraid !\".  The CG images. I still can't imagine their superabundance (1,500 shots) or ripeness. For little instance, the gathering of the robot and its maker in one cadre, which recurred numerously, was done flawlessly, despite how they talk, walk, or dance together. Naturally, a herculean effort was spent behind every second in this movie.  The snappy yet sane editing. Unlike countless action movies today, it didn't go crazy while the action sequences. The action itself reached top standard. And the costumes were so elegant; which added a lot to the movie's impressive look. Originally, see how the movie's makers didn't shy seeking help from the genre's masters, with hiring (Woo-ping Yuen), the action choreographer in the Matrix and Kill Bill movies, and also (Mary E. Vogt), the costume designer for the Men in Black series.  However, every giant has his foibles. I didn't like the music score in the third act. (A. R. Rahman) is a trademark for high quality I know, though the mix of huge orchestra, thunderous vocals, and solo trumpet was unattractive, silly – and with playing it time after time – boring too.  The editing lost some of its rationality in the third act. I thought the pace of it was too rash for its own good (I couldn't be convinced how the evil robot cloned himself that fast).  The street fights, while kidnapping the heroine by the evil robot, inclined to being surreal. For instance, no way none of those million bullets, shot by the police towards the bottom of the vertically turned over car, didn't hit (Aishwarya Rai) in the butt while sitting in it ! And sure the last fight dragged a bit, as if the CGI guys got cocky, and went to assure that they could do anything.  Casting (Santhanam) and (Karunas) as the inventor's funny assistants, and the movie's relief, was the sole casting mistake. They have no charisma, chemistry or talent for comedy. In another movie, those 2 characters could have served beautifully as Laurel and Hardy.  There was uncalculated-well violence; which could have been deleted, a slice of melodrama (like when the saved naked girl dies), and strange comedy (the somehow long and childish mosquito part). But while being not acceptable matters for the no Indian viewer, I think they somehow agree with the Indian viewers' taste. Exactly like the dance numbers, as fundamental ingredient of the entertainment's formula in the Indian cinema, knowing how their existence in any other sci-fi action, especially the Hollywood ones, is considered an unforgivable sin !  According to the fact that the Indian cinema produces more than 1000 movies per year, then this movie is a one in 10000 movies. Putting in mind its unbelievable image and box office success, it's safe to say that Enthiran is a revolutionary turning point in the Indian cinema's history, in terms of CGI and sci-fi popularity. And it's always a pleasure when you witness wild ambition gets wildly fulfilled like this."

But this movie clearly draws the line between intelligence and emotion. It shows that a machine can only be intelligent based on the knowledge. But a machine can start thinking on its own only when it gets the emotion. But a how a machine can get the emotion? This is what the director explains by giving the knowledge of Rig Vedas and spirituality which explains the knowledge of emotions.  Writer Sujatha has contributed to the above fact to the science.  Director Shankar has made the people to understand the concept easily. Also the director has contributed to the Technology by making 'Cluster of Robots'.  For imperfection in the visual effects, I've reduced 1 point."

Even the special effects by V.Srinivas Mohan is superb.  The action sequences by Peter Hein are marvelous.  Story:-  Location: Chennai 2010 Mission: Creating a android-humanoid robot Chitti (Rajinikanth) Purpose: To help the society Development time: 10 years  Configuration:Memory one zeta byte, processor Pentium ultra core millennium V2, FHP 450 motor from Hirata, Japan  Special Features:A human who is not born but is created. He can dance, sing, fight, is water and fire resistant. He can do all that a human can and more. He feeds on electricity. He takes instructions literally. Where a human can lie to save himself this android-humanoid robot Chitti cannot lie. Where he has a razor sharp memory and can memorize an entire telephone directory by just running through the pages, he cannot understand human emotions.  Dr. Vasi(Rajinikanth) upgrades Chitti's processor and simulates human emotions without realizing the repercussions. Chitti gets transformed. He can now feel, and the first feeling that he discovers is love. Will this love come in the way of Dr. Vasi's purpose of creating Chitti? Will Dr. Vasi's own creation destroy him?  The direction is excellent.  The action scenes as mentioned above are splendid.  The special effects are worthy of applause.  The music by A.R Rahman is subtle.  Performances:-  Rajinikanth is soul of Endhiran.Without Rajinikanth,ENDHIRAN would have been a disaster.Aishwarya Rai is subtle.Danny Denzongpa is excellent.

        "review": "If you want to enjoy \"Robot\" ensure it sans any prejudice against Rajnikanth. Its an entertainment vial delivered in its purest form. The sole reason I gave it a go was to check out the CGI's. Undoubtedly, \"Robot\" stands numero-uno from the factory of Indian Cinema in terms of CGI and would be a while until the position is challenged. The plot draws inspiration from quite a few pockets and let me abstain from listing spree. Noteworthy is the simplicity of the narrative which makes the every section of audience comprehend the proceedings The cinematic liberties are aplenty but get pushed under the carpet owing to the over- the-top production values. Shankar leaves no stone unturned to ensure his pet project matches international standards.  The Frankensteinian events which leads Chitti to the darker side is interesting to watch though slightly melodramatic. Rajnikanth does a Face/Off effortlessly by getting into the skin of Mr. Hyde with a distinct body language, mannerism and a luciferous laugh. \"Robot\" is manna from heaven for Rajnikanth fans. For starters he is in a double- role of a scientist and a humanoid, and then follows the transformation from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. Finally the Prince of Darkness clones himself into hundreds and fans are bound to shudder in delight.  Though an out-and-out Rajni movie, Aishwarya ensures she doesn't get relegated to the background with some stunning costumes, songs, dances and camera-work showcasing an ethereal beauty. Few flaws in the characterisation could have been brushed up with better writing. Danny is reliable though has a limited screen time. Rajni's two side-kicks appeared force-fit in the storyline in the garb of comedy. The plot could have easily done away without them.  A R Rahman customises his compositions to suit Rajnikanth sensibilities. Costumes, choreography and locales deserve a special mention. The mosquito conversation seems a product of brain-storming exercise and its sensibilities is open for debate.  PS: Do watch the acknowledgements to the army of technical soldiers who made the herculean task possible as the end-credits roll. Kudos!"

        "title": "What the heck is the fuss about?",
        "review": "Perhaps I went into viewing this film with too many expectations based upon what I had heard about it, but Endhiran just left me bemused.  On the plus side, yes it was marginally different to most Indian films but ultimately once you removed the very good veneer not that much different. That veneer was some of the glossiest and best effects seen in an Indian film ever, although even those at times were by no means a good as has been claimed (think low definition in an otherwise high definition presentation).  But the negative side? Whoa were there lots here. I don't think the writers actually knew where they wanted to take this film after they got into the meat of it and in the end it feels like a compromise that ended up going a well trodden path. Rather than being truly original they tried to seek inspiration from way too many robot sci-fi films which really destroyed where they were heading. Did they really need to go the robot runs amok route for instance? Jealous, bumbling lab techs? Been done to death by many a B-grade sci-fi film and I don't think it added much to the film other than a lot of length and poor attempts at humor.  Sorry to all the Rajnikanth fans out there but his recent work has not been of high standard to me (and that includes the woefully overrated Sivaji) and again his \"acting\" lets this film down badly. He does not have the emotional range that his character needed. Some of that perhaps lies in the casting. Whilst Aishwarya is undoubtedly a very beautiful woman, I cannot help but feel that this film needed perhaps less beauty and more substance that an older, better actor could have provided. The age difference of the actors here simply did not convince at all, for all Aishwarya's efforts, and the chemistry just did not seem to be there - and that relationship was crucial to the film.  The editing could have been a lot better too but in some respects I guess that they wanted to emphasize the technical aspects of the film which absorbed a large chunk of the budget no doubt. Indeed, too much seemed to be compromised to allow the effects to take center stage. Never a good idea, whether you are James Cameron or Shankar.  The effects themselves were never as smooth and realistic as those found in Hollywood. That in itself would not be a concern except there was a such a huge emphasis on the effects that every little issue with them became clear. If you are going to do an effects-laden film then you need to get the effects 100% spot on, something that a great director knows. Failure to do so can take the audience out of the illusion very easily as it does here on occasions.  Whilst I understand that the Indian viewing public expects and demands songs in their films, there really was no easy way to include them in this film without it being a huge distraction. Had this truly been a groundbreaking Indian film, they should have had the guts to cut the songs out. They added nothing to the film and took the viewer out of the storyline too much.  Maybe its just me and Shankar films but this was a disappointment of the highest order."

        "title": "Brilliance Atmost!!!!!!",
        "review": "Story  Dr Vaseekaran (RajniKanth) makes a Robot and gives him his own shape. The Robot is omniscient and omnipotent. His motive is to prepare his Robot to join Indian Army. He wishes to make many more such Robots to help Army and reduce loss of lives during wars. But Dr Vaseekaran's enemy, another scientist (Danny) disproves that his Robot cannot fit to be used for military purposes as it cannot think like a human. He states that it has no emotions and reasoning capacity. Dr Vaseekaran pumps in human feelings and reasoning capabilities and makes him almost a human. But things turn upside down. Robot starts loving Sana (Aishwarya Rai), the fiancée of Dr Vaseekaran. Robot gets attracted to Sana and that makes Vaseekaran angry. He destroys it. But the enemy scientist takes the destroyed Robot, repairs it and infuses destructive mechanism in it. He wants it to sell to some international gangsters. But the love for Sana in Robot aggravates as wild possessiveness and that pesters Sana. Robot becomes very strong physically and becomes like a cruel demon. It even kills the scientist who gives him second birth. It creates massive destruction to society by creating many Robots like itself. How Dr Vaseekaran deactivates the Robot and brings things to peace is the end of the film.  Artists Performance: Rajni Kanth is tremendously good at age 60. His moves, his gait and expressions didn't wane even a bit. He got connected to new age kids and they cannot forget him for rest of their lives. That way Rajni Kanth added another 60 years to his image. Aishwarya Rai is the true asset for the movie. Her glamour made a lot of difference. As a true goddess of beauty she enchanted everyone. Danny is apt in serious role. His performance is in contemporary international standards. If there is anything to speak about the film, that's technical brilliance. Music is in gen-next style. Sound is marvelous. Canning of songs is opulent. But the lyrics in Kilimanjaro are lewd and weak. Rest of the songs are fine. Director Shankar deserves great mention for making this biggest feat possible on Indian screen with a message.  Technical Departments:  Shankar is a master commercial director and he makes sure that there are ample commercial elements and conflict points that would appeal to masses. Though Robo is a science fiction movie, Shankar scored the biggest brownie point when he pitted Rajnikant against Rajnikanth. Though it is a story of a relationship between man and machine, Shankar has beautifully showcase the human-side of machine and mechanical side of human. The screenplay of the movie is smooth and direction is near perfect. Shankar lets his imagination wild during the last 30 minutes of the movie and it's spellbinding. Shankar's created Chitti character in such a way that it endearing to watch it's innocence. And you sympathize with Chitti even after it becomes rogue because Shankar has given enough justification for that. Robo is probably one of the very few Indians cinemas where villain is admired and adulated more than hero. The humor episodes of Chitti are rib-tickling. With Robo, Shankar proves that he is the best Indian film director in terms of grandeur, usage of technology and story telling.  Final Analysis:  This saying of great soul of Indian soil lingers in the mind while watching this film. Knowingly or unknowingly Shankar made a movie basing on this saying.  It's a movie for world children.  Yes, it truly influences the senses of new generation kids those developed relation only with video games but not human beings. Hardly there are joint families now where grand parents teach morals to kids. And the kids tend to listen only to machine. They tend to follow what machine says. And director Shankar aptly takes the way through machine, the Robot, to teach values.  Kids run away listening to words kama, krotha, lobha, moha, mada, matsaryabut they assimilate that when shown in a dramatic way. That too, not in the style of Chandamama stories. They want something with scientific reasoning. Hence the path is chosen through 'Robot'.  How peaceful the Robo was and how useful that was to society when it's free from those 6 evils. And how it becomes detrimental to itself and society when injects them into it. That's aptly narrated.  The true essence of the movie is narrated in the end. The dialogues delivered by Robot while dismantling himself are hitting the hearts. The dialogues touch every human being with introspection. And at last, a girl looks back and goes with a thoughtful grimace. That is a symbolism for entire world kids those will be in thought process from now.  First half is entertaining. The first 30 minutes of second half are not gripping in right standards. That part is boring. But the climax action episode is marvelous to be on Indian screen. The last few closing dialogues are impressive and with true essence.  Let us wish that this movie sows a seed at least in a few minds of children to prevent self entering into calculation while taking decisions.like a school girl that turns back and goes at the end on the screen."

        "title": "Heheheee... Doesn't stand up to the hype...",
        "review": "This is my honest review regarding the movie.  ...Contains spoilers...  I saw the movie on the second day of the release without any expectations. After seeing Shankar's last movie Sivaji - The Boss, I was completely disappointed. I was hoping for a redemption from Shankar. Then finally came the news that Shankar is direct his 10 years long awaited script Endhiran.  This script was written for lot of talented actors, but none of those actors were available due to scheduling conflicts. Finally the script went to Rajinikanth. The movie is said to have been made with the highest budget in Tamil film industry.  Here comes my review.  Special effects though not up to the Hollywood standards but very good for this movie. Special effects was put to good use in this movie. A note to other directors. See and learn how to use special effects in a movie from this one.  There are a few a things I like about this movie. Rajinikanth as a villain gives a top notch performance in the second half of the movie. Raishwarya Rai gives a very good performance so does the remaining cast. Rajinikanth gives a good performance as a Scientist and as a Robot. The difference between the Scientist, Robot and the Villain is clearly distinguishable. There are no punch dialogs. No grand entrance. Rajini as a scientist does not perform fight sequences. Soundtrack by A.R.Rahman are amazing. The little motion-soundtrack used in the movie were one of the best in Tamil film industry. Stunts are mind blowing. Finally, the stunt sequences not copied from other Hollywood movies.  Now to the story part. There is no story. Also, this movie is not unique. It is a rip-off mixture of I-Robot and Terminator series. The first half is okay enough to sit and watch. But the second half is a total drag. Couldn't wait for the movie to complete. The movie is very lengthy for a science-fiction. One or two songs could be removed as they are not needed. Also, a lot of things from the second half could be omitted as they are not interesting enough to watch but very tiresome. For example, Avatar is very lengthy but it was very interesting to watch as it is fast-paced and filled with amazing breath taking visuals and backgrounds. But Endhiran has a lot of scenes that feels too tiresome to watch.  Now to the worst part. The mosquito scene. This scene alone lowered the quality of the film by 40%. A stupid unnecessary idiotic scene in the whole. And, I was surprised that Shankar who instilled so much quality in this movie would insert such an annoyingly idiotic cheap scene. Is that the best he can do in terms of romance and comedy? If I ever lay my hands on you, I'll slap you like a mosquito. This scene is a total disgrace to the science- fiction genre and to the star value of Rajinikanth.  On a whole, it is an average movie that can be seen once for Special effects alone. And only for special effects. Don't believe a word from other reviews who say it is a fantastic movie. IT IS NOT. PERIOD. Don't listen to the other lunatics who compare this movie to Spider-man and Batman. Doesn't even come closer to those movies.  This is my rating for 10...  Performance as a whole - 6.5  Rajinikanth as a Robot and Scientist - 6  Rajinikanth as a Villain - 7.5  Story - 1.5  Originality - 0  Special effects - 8  Stunts - 6.5  On the whole, this movie gets a fair rating of 6/10."

        "title": "Artificially Unintelligent",
        "review": "To be honest this is the second review I am penning down for this movie. The first one was deleted by IMDb after another user reported abuse . The claims I had made in hat review regarding the mental health of those admired the movie thus stand vindicated.  However, I have waited for a good 5 years before again logging in to pen down my views on this movie or as we may call it a freak show.  The focal point in the movie is a love affair, something which our movies haven't been able to cut lose , may be for the dearth of ideas and imagination.  The only interesting parts of the movie are the action sequences featuring the Robot i.e. if you nurse realistic expectations about the VFX or conversely if you have a satirical disposition .  For the thinking man the movie presents 3 hours of ordeal and only the very brave or those on sedatives can sit through the movie. In 2010 I couldn't sit beyond half time and managed to watch the movie in bits and parts when it was subsequently telecast on TV.  Do look out for a scene whee mosquitoes are shown talking among themselves conspiring to bite and suck some blood out of Aishwarya's body. That scene sums up the artistic integrity of the movie in question."

Songs are good with Irumbile Irudhaiyam topping. Performance wise,Rajinikanth,no amount of praise is could describe his performance as Dr Vaseegaran and Chitti.He is truly a Superstar.Aishwarya Rai looks good and acts well too.Danny Dengzongpa is superb as Dr Bora.

        "title": "Enthiran should have come 10 years before",
        "review": "Director Shankar and Rajnikanth join hands again after the blockbuster movie Sivaji in Enthiran. Enthiran is an attempt at making a big budget sci-fi visual extravaganza. Though the film is a great success and the film has made enough and more money it was supposed to make, I guess everybody part of the cast and crew of the film can be proud about there achievement. But Enthiran is definitely not up to the mark. James Cameron's Avatar and Shankar's Enthiran suffer the exact same trouble, the dominance of visual content over the words that where supposed to form the foundation. Like Avatar, Enthiran was also not made for more than 10 years even when the writing was finished. I'm not a fan of Sci-fi films and I'm not the kind of person who is much impressed with the age old ideas of robots taking over humans. But I have watched a lot of films and I do like robot films at certain times. Terminator 2: Judgement day would be one such. It was a film from the creator of Avatar but a far more interestingly made film which I consider as one of the better action movies ever! Now leaving behind the aspect of content, how is Enthiran? I had response from different people and read a lot of reviews about the film which praised the visual quality of the film. But I sadly was highly disappointed by the visuals in the film. Indeed the films did have a couple of songs in beautiful locations and they looked great. The dual role and the lighting has also been interesting. But beyond that Enthiran does suffer a lot in the visual side. it may be because of the huge complexities involved in the construction of the scenes or shots. But can that be excuses? The visual effects of Enthiran is not a complete letdown. But in certain key portions of the film, the film does suffer a lot. The making of the fire sequence post the first hour of the film is one of the most disappointingly made sequences in the film. A. R. Rahman's background score does not back the film properly. With too many songs the film begins to run too long as well. There has been a lot of effort that has gone into the making of the film. A lot of money too. But for the visual experience the makers had in mind, they do have to put in more effort. And effort is expensive!"

        "title": "Exceeding in every \"bit\"",
        "review": "I mentioned the word \"bit\" in the summary deliberately. There is a joke with that exact word as well in the movie. But my summary just sums up how I enjoyed the minute details of the movie while rejoicing in the marvelous and enthralling large scale experience. Starting with the mellowed opening scene, everything has been crafted neatly. Whenever the movie seemed like going overboard, the director stamps his touch and brings the movie back on the neat track. Kudos to Rajnikanth for not having let his \"larger than the movie\" image to interfere with the movie's plot. The first half simply flies by with the standard ingredients of an Indian film - introduction of characters, the feel good duet song between the lead pair, the powerful action sequence(this one stands outs from the other movies because of its grandeur), the villain's grudge. Among all this, there are jokes with the robotic and technical terminology - a reminder of late Sujatha's touch. And just to enhance the curiosity the director plants the plot's twist on the stroke of half time. The second half is something unseen on Indian movies so far. Not only has it exceeded anything that has been done in Indian movies before, it has also proved to be good. Exemplary CG is not something Indian movies can boast of. Most of the times, CG in India movies becomes laughing stock. But with \"Endhiran\" we may have just crossed over. Such is the technical brilliance in the second half that we can be forgiven if we assume what happens is true. One more factor about CG in Indian movies is that too many technical features is something the audience normally does not approve of. It is here that the super star comes to the fore. Having started his acting career more as a villain rather than a hero, the ease with which he carries out the negative role in the second half tides over the CG overdose. It was as if he had longed to play a negative role for long and had found the avenue in this movie. One must appreciate the movie's producers for having had the faith. They trusted Rajnikanth and Shankar without wincing even slightly. Then one must appreciate the director's faith in his own ideas. He decided to wait for the right opportunity to launch the movie and did not compromise the movie's plot for Rajnikanth's image. And finally one must appreciate the super star's faith in the director. He put his enormous image at stake to take up a role that could have been easily ridiculed. As for the other areas, the songs have been placed in such a way that they do not bore the audience. Rahman more than makes up for the average soundtrack with the rocking background score. Picturization is pleasant and the locations for a couple of songs are breath taking. Art direction is at its best throughout the movie. On the whole Endhiran simply scorches from start to finish and the participants in the movie have only helped in fanning the flame. Well done Shankar! Very well done Rajnikanth!!"

        "title": "Rajni's show all the way, with less of Sci-fi and more of Shankar's gimmicks",
        "review": "This movie has been in the making for a long time. A 'Rajni' movie in itself is a festival in some parts of India, but this time it grabbed more limelight because of its budget, speculations of 'never-seen- before' special effects and promise of a sci-fi plot after a long time in Indian screen. Association of big names like Aishwarya Rai, A R Rahman, Resul Pookutty and Stanwinston Studios drove the media and the laymen into frenzy. And at last, with all the hype and attention the movie hit the silver screens across the world on the 1st of October 2010.  I watched the movie in Bangalore in Rex Cinemas on the 3rd of October 2010 at 11:30 AM. Following is my review of 'Enthiran':  The Negatives first:    The Positives:    Initially when it was announced that Rajni will do 'Robo', I was not sure that Rajni can pull off such a role. We are all used to seeing Rajni in a 'Larger-than-life' heroic character, but to see him in a sci- fi would be something else. But what a surprise! He is just splendid both as a scientist and a Robot. And you get more towards the end of the movie. Other than the characters essayed by Rajni, the other characters seem not so important, spare that of Aishwarya Rai. But nobody complains, off the screen. Fans will be shocked to see the movie without the ritualistic 'Introduction' song or any 'punch dialogues'. The movie starts and gets into the storyline immediately, garnished with light humour at places. Kids will enjoy some of the 'Robot acts'.  Cinematography is top-notch. Rathnavelu has managed to bring out crystal clear images with the right colour tone required. Amazing art direction by Sabu Cyril (he even gets a small acting role) brings out a futuristic feel to the movie. Music and sound have played a major role in raising the standard and the quality of the movie. As said before, the movie could have done with a couple of songs less, but the songs complement the movie and its theme. Dialogues by Shankar and Karky are apt and they keep it simple, that enables even a non-technical person to enjoy the film, by not overloading with technical jargons. Same goes to the lyrics by Vairamuthu and Karky too; they have tried to 'Tamilize' the science to make it enjoyable to the common man. And they do succeed to an extent in that.  Technically, as said by many, it will take some time to better the climatic sequence of 'Enthiran'. The animatronics aided by the grand imagination of Shankar, surely does set the screen on fire. The last 20 minutes of the movie is real 'paisa vasool'. And this is also the part, where Rajni gives a splendid performance, which is surely going to drive the audience crazy. A thrilling end to an awesome movie. But wait; there is an epilogue too, with the 'message' from the movie.  The movie has its flaws, but one tends to overlook and forgive those when in awe of watching a technically brilliant masala entertainer.  Now, the BIG question? Should one watch it?  Answer – YES! Should watch it at least once. Though we are still a long way to catch up with Hollywood (or do we really need to do that?) we sure have the imagination and the means of converting that into a cinematic experience. This is truly a magnificent effort mounted on a lavish scale. Go watch it!!!"

        "review": "Endhiran – ROBOT – ( A ) Robot is true entertainer, with wild action sequences and high quality graphics. The special effects of the movie are comparable to Hollywood movies. Rajnikanth is the man who made it so enjoyable with his performance. The difference of performances between engineer Rajnikanth and Robo before and after interval is spectacular. No one can imagine that it's the same person. Aishwarya Rai looked stunning in this movie; usually in commercial movies she doesn't look as stunning as to traditional movies. But this time in every frame and shot she leaves her beauty and performance mark. The director S.Shanker gave an amazing direction and A.R.Rahman's score is splendid as always. Overall, A complete package of fun, drama, action and entertainment."

        "title": "Even a million copies cant face the real Rajnikanth...Mind It!",
        "review": "\"Who is this? Looks like your twin brother!\" exclaims the surprised mother of a long haired & bearded Dr. Vaseegaran (Rajnikanth, trying to be ever-fresh). \"No. This is my work of several years, a Robot\" he explains, returning home after those several years. This humanoid machine introduces itself in terms of it's speed & memory. The mother christens him \"Chitti\".  He is introduced to the world at a science meeting by Dr.Vasi. Chitti knows all the sciences, languages, dances, music, martial arts and other things worth knowing from around the world. Everything but human feelings which couldn't be programmed even with Artificial Intelligence.  But nothing is impossible when Rajnikanth is the hero. He succeeds in this endeavour too and the rest of the movie is all about the (disastrous) consequences of creating a machine with emotions. A cliché, that is. The only redeeming moments of this film end within the first part. Towards the interval & after it, you somewhat know how the movie will progress and end after 2 hours. So the only things which can compel you to keep your seat warm, remain the editing & CG effects that are (as promised) superior to any other Indian film. This is also touted to be the costliest Indian film to date, at an estimated Rs. 180 crore which supposedly doesn't include Rajnikanth's fees (who is rumoured to take at least Rs. 40-50 crore per movie) as he is said to have refused his fees after the debacle of his previous venture(Kuselan).  The heroine does have a role in taking the story forward. It's said the role was written for Preity Zinta and offered to many other heroines before it finally reached Aishwarya Rai Bachhan (Who's gonna ask her for acting skills?). Film-makers (Indian and worldwide) have successfully realised that Aishwarya Rai has a face which can convince people to part with their hard earned money and watch her smile & dance for 2-3 hours on the big screen. Danny in a stereotyped villain role was certainly not convincing. I missed the presence of Late actor Raghuvan here. R.I.P  This movie dubbed & released worldwide seems to have been received very well by Rajni fans as well as people who are not used to seeing Rajni's movies. Yes, I actually heard of loads of people(personal friends as well as through the net) who don't see Rajni movies but were mighty impressed by his style. The way I see it, there are still millions of fans who expect their heroes (like Rajnikanth, Vijaykanth, Salman Khan) to enter a scene with style & pack some punches into the bad guys. Rajni has grown old & so has the cliché concept. So they used a Rajni-like Robot to justify the action scenes.  Agreed, the movie was an entertainer throughout the approx 150 min runtime. That is, if you promise to not use too much of your brains. You have seen how it started. You have an idea how it must end. What remains to lookout for is how the story winds its course. Some people may disagree with me on this but in my opinion for all the CG effects, Endhiran(the Tamil titled version of Robot for tax-free ticket) had more of a story to tell than even the amateurish Avatar did!  6/10  (plus one for attempting to use more of advanced technology in Indian film-making)"

        "review": "I love critique...with a positive spin.This is my first review in IMDb.And i'm proud kicking it off with a movie like ROBOT/ENTHIRAN.  Folks!Lets talk simple physics for a moment.Newtons III law \"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\" is justified again!.... ACTION : 10yrsdream,2yrsproduction,150crores budget,zillion expectations. REACTION : Cheers!,Claps!,Whistles!Period.  FLATTERING ROBOT AS A REGULAR VIEWER... First up, forget about the technical jargon like SFX,CG,Animatronics,domes lighting(ah!that David Fincher's Benjamin button stuff!)blah blah blah! Watching a movie is all about experience. And you'll have it tons with robot. I know there are inception,avatar and titanic.But its for the Hollywood. Since this is the first Indian movie to rub shoulders with Stan Winston studios,I am proud about it.Seems like Shankar has pushed the boundaries of Indian cinema.And together with Rajini(at 61),he has proved their combination as unparalleled. To me,the magnum opus of the Robot is the train scene which is powered by A.R.Rahaman's score.I say...Indian action at its best. This scene is alone worth your hard earned bucks. kudos to Yuen Woo- ping,peter hanes&team. My fave dialog \"Happy Diwali folks\" by chitti 2.0 followed by boom boom bang bang dabang!  WRITING ABOUT ROBOT AS A POTENTIAL CRITIC... Being fair, i hated the roller-coaster like,SFX&CG flooded climax.I feel,They've re-routed the plot.(and its not something of a Shankar's trademark).His previous works \"okeyokkadu\",\"Aparichuthudu\" sport a screenplay par excellence.But robot lost it. If i was given the editing job for robot,i would have cut the mosquitoes scene dead! It doesn't obey the screenplay rules. The editor should have cut corners. Your two minutes are wasted...literally!Go out for a cup of coffee during this scene. no problem! Songs placement in the second half seems to be contrived!  Finally,Robot raised the bar of Indian Cinema and Shankar relieved the pressure of being Shankar. Be responsible!Don't be a pirate!Go watch Robot in a theater.Its worth more than the regular popcorn and a soda can! move your ass! hit the nearest cinemas!  P.S. Eventually,Robot is a lollipop every Indian should suck on! and no matter how it is, say \"yummy\" cos' that's the only way to get...more lollipops. :-)"

        "title": "A B Movie That Takes Way Too Long To Be Interesting",
        "review": "Enthiran is about a scientist who constructs a robot for military purposes but then complications get in the way. Clocking in about three hours you expect more of a deeper story but no this movie just contains a lot of filler. Namely the unnecessary singing. There had to of been 6-7 songs which is about 30 minutes of the movie. That is just ridiculous and some didn't even match the story. If this film was less than two hours I might have enjoyed it more, as the overall experience wasn't worth the time commitment.  Other negatives I came across was definitely the acting quality for starters. It felt over the top or soap opera quality which is really annoying to hear. The CGI was laughable at times. The acting and CGI reminded me of the 1999 film Inspector Gadget. Except this movie appeared to be a serious film while Inspector Gadget was a cheesy kids movie but the similarities are too glaring to ignore.  The only real positive I found was some of the action sequences and the overall creativeness of those scenes. They were fast paced and at times strange. Strange being like Jim Carrey's The Mask strange. These are the kinds of things I love to see in B action movie scenes the randomness as at least I can get a laugh out of the movie.  Currently this film sits at a 7.1 and is rated in the top 250 for Indian movies. I don't know if I am just missing something or what but this movie just really failed to deliver in my eyes."

        "review": "This is a review by a westerners point of view. I will not go over the story in this review, just how it may be received by foreigners not from India.  This movie was jam packed with awesome action scenes and great visual effects. If you are not from India and you have not seen a Indian film before you will be confused by the music video like scenes. Rest assured though these dance scenes are common in Indian cinema, so you may have to get use to it. There are a total of I believe 5 to four dance scenes, most of which have great choreography and different themes. Two of which have sci-fi themes!  The visual effects are a bit off by an American point of view, keep in mind though our visual effects here are perceived different. It's not that The Matrix, or Avatar seems more realistic than this movie, it's just the concept of real is different in India than our perception. Even the sound effects of pistols were different, and will come off as \"fake\" or \"cheap\" sound effects, again this is the perception of what is real.  Even as an American who watches many movies, I would definitely rate this a 7.0 out of 10 stars. The visual effects are great, the story is wonderful, and the acting is believable and top notch.  If you love action, and you love sci-fi, give this movie a chance! You will not be disappointed."

        "title": "interesting story spoiled by LOUSY GRAPHICS + A VERY OLD ACTOR",
        "review": "I read the reviews here for this movie.. and i must say that those reviews ARE NOT HONEST. I'm pretty sure that those reviews were written by those SOMEHOW CONNECTED to this film (friends or staff related to this film or HARDCORE RAJNI FANS). That's why they give 9 OUT OF 10 RATINGS (there is no way that this movie deserved 9 OUT OF 10 RATINGS!!). Please don't post fake ratings.. IMDb users like myself only want to read sincere reviews.  Kindly take not that i'm not a fan of any actor. If a movie is good.. than i'll say its good, and if its bad.. than i'll say its bad. I will give you my HONEST REVIEW.  And so here is my HONEST REVIEW for this movie. I was excited to watch this movie (with all the advertisement hype). But then when i watched it, i have to say i was sadly disappointed. This movie was 2h:45mins long, and the GRAPHICS for the first 2h:15mins WAS LOUSY and sometimes even silly too (NOT REALISTIC). Only the last 30mins graphics was although not fantastic, it was BETTER (a scene where 1000+ robots join together to form a giant snake or giant robots.. this was MORE REALISTIC). But then they have to spoil this interesting final scene with SILLY CAR EXPLOSIONS (the usual crappy car explosions that you see in most Tamil movies).  Here are some examples of LOUSY GRAPHICS:.  1) At time 0h:06mins the robot will perform an Indian dance (this was really silly, because the robot is made with SOLID METAL STRUCTURE and so its not flexible like a human bone.. this scene reminded me of the scene from \"JEANS\" (1999 Tamil movie) where the skeleton does the this same dance.  2) At time 0h:55mins the robot flies into a burning building to save people. Again LOUSY GRAPHICS spoiled this scene when the robot fly into the building (it was very CARTOONISH). It would have been better if they just put a jet pack on the back of the robot to fly (like the IRON MAN English movie). And when inside the building you could clearly see that an ACTUAL MAN IS WEARING a PLASTIC ROBOT SUIT.. this was REALLY PATHETIC GRAPHICS (i just didn't understand why didn't they just use the graphics for the robot).  3) At time 1h:05mins at the hospital the robot will use ULTRASOUND IMAGING to show the baby inside a woman's womb. Again LOUSY GRAPHICS spoiled this scene with a CARTOONISH BABY graphics (are you kidding me.. they can't even create a more realistic looking baby!!).  Anyway, the MAIN PROBLEM for this is not so much the LOUSY GRAPHICS.. its Rajnikanth (he's way too old for action movies). Rajni is over 60 and bald, and even though they've put a great wig on him and multi-coated his face with makeup.. he still looks VERY OLD. His body looks very frail and weak too.. you just can't hide it. This age problem is too obvious to hide.  Rajni and his hardcore fans needs to accept the truth that he is TOO OLD FOR ACTION MOVIES. Rajni is a talented actor, BUT Rajni is 60+ so he needs to stop doing action movies.. and start acting his own age like Amitabh Bachaan or Kamal Haasan. This TAMIL ACTION movie is more suited for younger heroes like Surya or Aarya.  Kindly take not that i'm not a fan of any actor. If a movie is good.. then i'll say its good, but if its bad.. then i'll say its bad. I will give you my HONEST REVIEW.  I will give 8/10 rating for: Interesting story.  I will give 3/10 rating for: LOUSY GRAPHCS (from 0h:00mins - 2h:15mins).  I will give 6/10 rating for: Better Graphics (from 2h:15mins - 2h:45mins).  I will give 5/10 rating for: My OVERALL FINAL RATING."

        "title": "Boring junk",
        "review": "\"Cheap junk\" is the first thing that comes to mind in the first few seconds (really) of this film's 2 hours and a half torture session. The opening shows the building of the robot in CGI, which feels like a cheap 1990's PC video board demo (e.g., some \"pieces\" are placed on solid surface, but instead of lying there, they \"sink in\", as they are actually indentations, like ACME's portable holes being placed on metal and subtracting instead of adding material).  Next scene is in a lab, where the two main characters, the scientist and his creation, made upon his image, are shown with two co-workers... Which are punched and kicked away by the robot, in a very \"El Chapulín Colorado\" manner (except that, instead of chromakey, they used invisible cables, which the \"actors\", if one dares calling them so, dangle and swing like puppets from). And guess what, those are the best effects on the whole film! What comes after makes one wish they at least used those same goofy practical effects. The CGI blending with live action is horrendous, what is ridiculous, as the robot is computer generated, not a stop-motion animated model.  The laughable effects could be attributed to the film being a comedy... But no, it's a comedy just in the first ten minutes (with stupid unnecessary drama mixed along), then it becomes a musical... And no, it's not a metaphor, it's literal, the film changes style from a wannabe comedy/drama to a musical, as the robot starts singing while it's being assembled. From then on, random music clips are played along the film, pushing its whatever style to musical again, just to go back to whatever it was supposed to be. As far as I know, it seems to be a norm on Bollywood films, to play random music clips for no reason in the middle of scenes, which causes this torture to be half an hour longer than it would without.  Next, the film becomes a full drama, because the scientist is a major jerk. He treats his co-workers like crap (going as far as programming other robots that appear on the lab to not serve them coffee, just water, barely, and replying meaningly to them) and he makes faces every time his girlfriend tries to contact him (he doesn't even bother calling back or replying to her messages). Although the script tries to make it look like he changes through the film, here and there his despicable superiority shows, making him impossible to like.  Indeed, except for the girl, all characters in this film are despicable (the girl is just the stereotypical \"damsel in distress\", interestingly, not as dumb as the scientist, most of the time). The robot is annoying, as it has no safety protocols (a plot device, used in a scene by an evil competitor to demonstrate to a board of sponsors that it's dangerous and its creator was a failure).  To save you the time, I'll summarise the rest of the film: creator fails to sell the robot's project; robot falls in love with its creator's girlfriend; robot tries to protect girl from mosquitoes; creator tries to destroy robot in frustration and jealousy; robot is reprogrammed by evil competitor's red (evil) chip; robot kills competitor and tries to take over the world, building many copies of itself; creator tries to destroy robot again; robot goes berserk and kills hundreds of people; creator destroys copies and removes evil chip from robot; creator is sued, but robot saves him by assuming all blame; robot is ordered to destroy itself; robot's head is still functional in a museum, or is it just a hallucination...?! The end...?!  Why did I mention the mosquitoes? Because it's too stupid not to mention. The whole scene plays like this: robot goes to lab to recharge; it recollects the day's memories; it decides to conquer the girl's heart and goes to her house; it invades her bedroom, while she's sleeping, finding a mosquito sucking her blood; it decides to avenge her; it goes after the running away mosquito; it TALKS to the mosquito and coerces it to go back and apologise to the girl; mosquito apologises; girl kisses robot; random music clip.  At first sight, I thought the robot had dreamt it all, but there is a scene near the end in which the robot mentions the girl's blood type... Seriously, all that dumbness to insert a dumb plot device for a dumb twist?! The robot could've known about her blood type reading medical records or whatever (there is another scene, near the beginning, in which the robot shows off how much knowledge it's capable of accessing and handling, recognising people it has never seen before just by being given their id numbers or names or something). Maybe blood type is a taboo in India, so it's not stored in databases, I don't know...  If you are a Science Fiction fanatic, you will watch this film don't matter what other people say. Just be warned that you will waste two and a half hours of your life for a very forgettable junk, except that it's so bad that it will be very difficult to forget. For those looking for a so-bad-it's-good film, don't even try, because this is not the good kind of bad, it's the other kind, the boring, never ending kind of bad."

        "title": "The worst joke of a sci-fi film I've seen for the ambition of being something extraordinary",
        "review": "With this film it just goes to show that no matter how much money they spend on smashing cars, massive sets, extras and CGI (which is not that good, by the way) you still get a story created and told by someone with intelligence no more than that of a 12-year old. To add to that are the stunts that defy the laws of physics, stupid dances by the android, infantile dialogues, fake acting, some absolutely ridiculous conversations of the robot with mosquitoes, laughable fights and giant worms, pyramids and other fighting structures made up of robots turning this in the end into a complete grotesque made-by-amateurs-in-a-garage joke, no matter how expensive it was.  I realise there are huge cultural differences in what is perceived a good film and I'm happy to ignore those to get to the bare bones of it, but there certainly exists a universal appreciation by all human beings of what is good and original, and if you also strip the film of all that is western in the way the movies are created including the stolen ideas from western sci-fi film (The Matrix, several robot films), all the cars and technology, as well as of the purely Indian thing here - the dancing-singing numbers - one is left with nothing more than a pile of rubbish.  The only good thing about this film is actually those dancing and singing clips that have nothing to do with the story. Visually and choreographically very beautifully done (excluding the songs, that is). Maybe Indian film-makers should stick to those Bollywood ways of making movies that I'm sure some of them are deserving every praise in their own right and not embarrass themselves any more.  P.S. Some Indian fans called it the Indian I, Robot. And so it is. The only question is: is this all they are capable of producing?"

This is what makes the film work. Really,Shankar has used the script in a such a way that all other elements work in good coordination. The action,music,VFX,screenplay,script and good dose of commercial elements makes this movie truly entertaining at its best. It had once again proved that Rajini is unbeatable.

It's painful to watch when a respected and admired actor is portrayed as a scientist with weird appearance and a clown robot which does gimmicks. Time and time again, it's proved that a movie with boat load of bloat CGI won't be a massive hit unless it's accompanied by a good plot, captivating screenplay and apt visualization. In Enthiran, Shankar failed to realize where he could infuse CGI and where he couldn't. Result is chaotic! Aishwarya Rai is misused again. It's clearly evident that a good amount of research went in to the movie. There's a lot of cheapness to the richness in this movie. A rape attempt on Aishwarya?"

        "title": "For the kid in you..",
        "review": "Wait is over & here it is for all to see, Shankar's dream project \"Enthiran\", starring Rajnikanth & Aishwarya Rai. Movie is produced by Sun Pictures & music by A.R.Rahman & is billed to be the most expensive movie ever made in India. So naturally movie of such magnitude gets & has gotten everyone excited. Does all the hype & hoopla gets reflected in the end product is a different question altogether.  If you detach Rajnikanth & the amazing visual effects from the movie, with all its wretched writing & appalling screenplay it would have been easily the worst product from Shankar. Somehow the performer in Rajnikanth (he is amazing in the role of the Robot especially with the negative shades reminiscent of his memorable villainy of yesteryear) & the visual effects of the US-based Stan Winston Studios and Industrial Light & Magic seem to blind everyone of the many pedestrian aspects of the movie.  While watching the movie one gets resonating thoughts from one of Shankar's own production \"Arai En 305il kadavul\". Like how Shanthanam & kanja Karupu make use of the power of the almighty , here too Shankar seems to have done the same with the mighty money that has been invested in the movie. Especially the final 30 mins are freaking insane which sure gratifies juvenile instincts of the grown up kids.  Shankar needs to get all the accolades for making this movie happen in the first place. Notwithstanding the run of the mill script , he has shown the hard work , perseveration, imagination & moreover guts to conceive & create movie of this magnitude & making the world turn back & make notice of a Tamil movie. If only he had concentrated more on the script , then it would have made Indian film industry proud .  Rajnikanth is the prime reason why the movie is getting all the notice it is getting . It is a delight to watch him the role of the Robot with all the negative shades. One saw glimpses of that in \"Chandramuki\" but here he has satiated many people's desire to see him a role with hard core villainy. Even at 60+ , the charisma he exudes on screen is unbelievable.  Aishwarya Rai looks radiant & dances well. Unlike in most of her movies here at least she has done some amount of work albeit in showcasing his dancing skills. Otherwise she continues in her merry ways as far her acting skill is concerned.  Danny Denzongpa , Shanthanam & Karunas are all grossly underutilized.  A.R.Rahman's music , which was proclaimed to be another main point of the movie , falls flat. No song has the quality that the previous one's of the Shankar-Rahman combo had. Background score is at best mediocre.  Rathnavelu's camera work is adequate. His efforts couple with that of the visual effects team make the viewing grand & in some instances jaw dropping.  Anthony's editing is adequate overall but at times very ordinary especially the song sequences jumps out all of the sudden.  On the whole , \"Enthiran\" is a \"Pizza made in Muniyandi vilas\"  Bottomline : For the kid in you.."

        "title": "Great movie, but skip the dancing sequences",
        "review": "What is there to say, amongst these lyrical reviews by Indian fans of 'Superstar Rajinikanth'?  Yes, it is an interesting movie. As is to be expected from a movie about robots from 'the East', where robots are becoming a familiar sight in peoples daily lives, while in the West robots for most people are still science fiction.  And yes, the special effects are pretty cool, although they do look a little bit cheap here and there (try to watch them without sound and you will see what I mean). It's definitely the first time that I saw a swarm of humanoid robots, and director Shankar (who also wrote the screenplay) definitely gets the most out of this ingenious concept, both visually and conceptually.  I fact, the idea and its elaboration are so cool, it's easy to forgive the filmmakers the a bit too simple story and rather flat characters. Girlfriend Sana is only beautiful (although rather extremely beautiful) and her only goal in life is to get the attention of her boyfriend. The helpers of the inventor are only (very) silly and start a big mess by falling in the trap of the bad guy and the bad guy is... well.. dressed in black and jealous and all that.  That's OK. But what is UNFORGIVABLE, for Western eyes, is that the middle of the coolest action, everybody just starts dancing! Why would they do that? The kitsch Bollywood music videos that you find yourself suddenly watching are really silly, are totally unrelated to style of the rest of the movie, take the flow out of it and they are just WAY TOO LONG.  And why are they situated all over the world? The story is situated exclusively in India, but all of a sudden you see the main characters dancing in Peru,of all places. Why? Did the director need an excuses for having a nice trip to some other continents? Or do Indian spectators don't mind this incongruity? Or, more interesting still, do they actually appreciate it?  As reviewer Mahesh Kothamangalam on IMDb said: 'The songs are spectacular. Shankar shows the audience some of the best places in the world all for a few bucks.' Now, that's another way to look it! Maybe I should try to reevaluate my all too rational European expectations and judgment, but when people start dancing in an otherwise cool movie, I really have a hard time doing that. Hello cultural difference!  So, if you don't like musicals (or just don't want them to be mixed up in your sf movie), skip the silly dancing and singing parts. You will see, this is actually a great movie. And if you want to know what the future of cinema is, don't skip the dancing parts. India with 1.2 billion people is one of the largest emerging economies. Bollywood probably really IS the new Hollywood."

        "title": "Romantic Robots",
        "review": "If you are not Indian, you, like me, probably first heard about Endhiran by seeing fantastic clips of fighting androids on YouTube. With special effects and creativity like that, how could one go wrong? Right? Good enough acting. Decent writing (maybe my issues with the story and dialogues are just cultural or lost in translation). Great special effects. Decent song and dance numbers if you are into that sort of thing. Forever. Seriously: FOREVAAAAARR. After the first hour, I thought that they would be tying up the story soon. After all, how much more ritz could they put on about romantic robots? Much much more than my friends and I could handle. It is an enjoyable movie, but it is far too long and the songs get really old and merely draw the movie out rather than advance the story (and my enjoyment). If there were a version condensed down to just over an hour with only a few dances, it would probably be awesome and worthy of 8.5/10."

        "title": "Skip the first half",
        "review": "If you want to see a film with ill conceived characters riddled with a full length music video every 15 minutes, then see the first half. If you decide to give it a skip, the first half summary is as follow: Robot is created, evil jealous professor lurking in background, robot experiences emotions, robot falls in love with beautiful, but lacking in depth, Sana.  90 minutes later, the real film begins with some spectacular special effects and creativity that shines in the end. Why this was 155 minutes is beyond me - a more compact, less music video orientated film with better conceived characters would have been far superior to this.  Either way, worth seeing the second part."

        "title": "Philosophy of Endhiran",
        "review": "Why Enthiran is the best Thalaivar movie ever?  1. Rajnikanth's religious and caste ideology has been expounded best in Endhiran: The movie gives two clear lines of thought: 1. Man is creation of God. Thus he is superior to all creations not directly attributed to God. That is, no force can replicate the harmonic balance, which God can, while creating cognitive organisms. 2. Creation is a divine process, and man should not undertake it, if he does, he shall face grave consequences. On further observation, we observe both the points are essentially the same. And what is indirectly suggested is that the epistemological processes of creation can only be understood through spiritual means, not through rational processes, as we know them. Also the essential dichotomy between feudal and capitalist morals which plagues modern upper class/caste Hindu thought, seems to be have been solved, through an extension of the Hegelian dialectic apparatus, this is bit of an extrapolation of the process, and capitalism and feudalism do not exactly constitute a thesis anti-thesis pair. The solution to this is the usual 'detached wealth condition' that is primitive accumulation of wealth in the material world, but apparently not using it for sensory benefits. If one notices, these points have been reinforced and many levels, conscious and sub-conscious. In the scene where the Robot scans the books and reads them, all the books albeit one, are flashed too fast for one to read the title, the only noticeable title is a book on Hindu philosophy titled, if my memory is correct, Vedanta. This can be interpreted in two ways. One is the beautiful cinematic technique used to present one moment of apparent stillness in between flashing images that disturb the mind. So one can seek Hinduism as a method of spiritual tranquility. This is the same technique used in Godard's Alphaville and Bergman's Persona to reinforce certain Freudian illusions in the viewer's mind. Another way to interpret this would be, that this scene is to show the superiority and philosophical complexity of Hindu thought: the robot that presumably can soak up volumes on Phenomenology and Quantum Electrodynamics in an instant stutters and take just that bit longer to digest this! In other Thalaivar movies too, this has been attempted, like in Baba, but not so successfully, because other movies tried to force on the viewer certain interpretations in too conscious a manner, ad nauseam, as in Baba; or lost track of the dialectic part, thereby leaning too much towards feudalism in Muthu, Padayappa, or suddenly veering into a tangential path like a sheer confusion on Left Hinduism and Capitalism as in Sivaji. Thalaivar Rajni's caste ideology is also very clear in this movie. In the scene where Aishwarya Rai and Thalaivar go to some scenic place and meet a lower caste toddy tapper. At first Aishwarya Rai, just to play around with Thalaivar, interacts with the toddy tapper on equal terms, but when the toddy tapper tries to do the same, he is shown his place, reinforcing that the lower castes can never be actually be equal, \"It is a joke you are equal to us\" – you must know your place in society. If one notes, nowhere is the toddy tapper at fault, he actually first refuses Rai's offers but them gives in, his only mistake was an upper class/caste lady could be his. But of course, our dear Rajni cannot allow this unholy mix. In the scene where Aishwarya Rai is disturbed by some devotional music being blared on a loudspeaker, and Rajni comes to save the day. It almost seems a negation of the rest of the clear Hindu messages in the movie, but it is not so. If one notices, the song and the people involved are all lower caste people. This clearly indicates, the hierarchical nature in which Hindu thought is presented, Rajni chooses to represent only the higher level abstractions (a prerogative of the upper class/caste) and rejects the simple lower caste interpretations of Hinduism. Another scene in which the religious ideology comes out clearly is when the robot is asked whether God exists. A cryptic reply almost forces the viewer to think more about a question which no more valid than if angels live at the bottom of ponds. Yet another place where Rajni's philosophy shines through is when the robot rescues a girl who is naked, who chooses to commit suicide, rather than live with the 'horror' of people having seen her naked. This clearly shows Rajni's deep conservatism and how he thinks women should – submissive about their sexuality, unconfident of their bodies and very conscious of so-called divine morals, to the extent that death is presented as a better option. Besides, a minor point is the presence of a woman who acts as a distracting influence in the progress of science and humanity. All the above philosophy has been presented very subtly, and in its content is very profound. Yet, it has been stuffed into a commercially successful movie, which I believe is an achievement. 2. Technical brilliance: The movie features some excellent visual effects and graphics, which are very new for a tamizh movie, within a framework understandable to people. People could experience for the first time Hollywood style action in an Indian context. 3. First ever sci-fi movie ever in tamizh. Elements of what a robot is has been presented very well to an Indian audience which is not acquainted with them. 4. Use of Apple products as symbols. All the good guys use macs and the other guys use HP ! An elitist product has been associated with the goodness, showing who Rajni's believes does good for the society."

        "review": "I don't want to write long bla bla about this. Go and see it! The main character of the movie is somewhere well beyond Superman, Neo and many others :)) A very funny and visually impressive creation. I'll never forget it. The movie is a combination of modern sci-fi and classic Indian musicals. You may not watch this on a small screen. Get yourself a projector or see if any cinema around you still plays this film. It MUST be seen in huge format. The audio also has to be heard from big speakers at highest quality possible. It's not a Hollywood movie, but it can beat many American productions. Congrats to those who made it!  Some of my colleagues said it's not worth watching. Maybe they didn't get the idea: it is a sci-fi action on steroids for those who are able to laugh when sensing over-blown stuff."

        "title": "With RAJNIKANT all the way, it's just like a DABANGG from the South.",
        "review": "Writing the first sentence of my review, I can truly feel that how easy it is to write about a 150 crore movie, (the costliest Asian film till date) and how difficult it would have been making it for its entire team. So, saluting the makers for attempting this kind of gigantic and daring venture, I would readily like to accept that ROBOT undoubtedly has many FIRSTS in it, never ever tried before in our Indian Cinema. Hence it is indeed a must see for all for this particular reason alone. But other than this it has Rajnikant, Shankar and his unbelievable vision which further makes this herculean project, a mandatory watch for all lovers of cinema living anywhere in the world including Hollywood.  However, after ranking it as a must watch flick, I would also like to add that though it is a spectacular show with Rajnikant all the way, still as a movie it's not flawless and does have its own negative points as usual. In fact for me Rajnikant's ROBOT was just like watching Salman's DABANGG, which despite of being a weak film, went on to become the TOP GROSSER of Hindi Cinema only due to its huge Star Magic on the screen. Exactly same is the case with ROBOT where in also, even when you know that the happenings are not perfect, the songs are not melodious and the length is too heavy, still in the end you somehow love watching it and enjoy your favourite star making all those Robotic moves on the silver screen with guts.  First, let's state the reasons why it requires to be seen by all? The biggest factor undeniably remains RAJNIKANT and the second is the highly imaginative vision of its director SHANKAR. Both the director and his star actor deserve all the praises for planning, visualizing and executing such a huge extravaganza on the celluloid which at times, seems to be like a dream. The computer graphics sequences, especially in the climax generate a jaw dropping impact on the viewer, when there are hundreds of Rajnikant clones making mass destruction on the screen like the ancient demons. In the first half, the heroic acts of CHITTI, the Robot Rajnikant are capable of making every Rajni fan shout, clap and whistle in excitement. The action is an amalgamation of films ranging from SPIDERMAN and MATRIX to GODZILLA. In few words, if you are huge appreciator of Hollywood science fictions and action movies, then you got to see ROBOT as its par with the standards set by all those western films in the past. Hence on technical grounds ROBOT is simply perfect and takes Indian Cinema many steps ahead in the world of film-making. But coming to its negative points, first of all it doesn't have a convincing storyline which keeps you guessing till the end. Although in its first half, ROBOT offers pretty enjoyable sequences with a mixture of action, comedy, romance and fun. But post intermission, it all becomes easily predictable as there happens to be a villain scientist as usual who wishes to take over the ROBOT and sell it to the terrorists. And then as revealed in its promos the Robot very questionably falls in love with his creator's fiancé and transforms into a negative personality in the end. Secondly, ROBOT hugely disappoints in its music department, where Rahman has nothing exceptional to offer either in the form of a dance number, love ballad or a sad song. May be the songs sound better in their original language version. But in Hindi, the soundtrack is not at all impressive from any angle.  Lastly, as mentioned before, ROBOT also walks on the same thin line like DABANGG, wherein every action on the screen largely depends upon its STAR ENIGMA and STAR AURA. In both the movies, had there been any other actor performing the same act then the story surely would have been different and probably disastrous. In clear words, these are the kind of movies which are especially made keeping in the mind the MAGIC of their lead actors and are precisely designed around this sole important factor alone.  So if you are die-hard fan of RAJNI then this is a treat for your eyes as the veteran is back in his famous form in the double role of a Robot and its scientist creator. Aishwarya looks gorgeous (better than her many recent films) and enacts her role fine. Danny is OK too, but he is not able to add anything new to his usual seen before villainous acts. The rest of the cast performs satisfactorily remaining under the big shadow of its lead actor. And thankfully the dubbing in Hindi was much better this time as compared to the last few films coming from the South.  In all, ROBOT is more a SHANKAR movie than a RAJNI film altogether considering its brilliant cinematography, imaginative sets and mind blowing execution (like the one dealing with the blood sucking mosquitos). It's a magnificent show put up by the team backed by a weak storyline, lackluster music and a lengthy second half. In my opinion, if you are making a film with a budget of 150 crores then there should be no stone left unturned in any of its department as a must. Shankar, frankly should have worked more creatively towards the story, music and editing of the film as these remain the only burdens in this otherwise must watch experience.  Summing up, I would like to call ROBOT as the DABANGG of the South. If DABANGG had a hit musical score to its credit, then ROBOT has its unbelievable Computer Graphics as an additional attraction which works in its favour. And if DABANGG can become the Top Grosser Ever, then ROBOT surely can reach the same status too with the blessings of all RAJNI and SHANKAR fans. So you can easily make your choice."

The visual effects were amazing with coming from an Indian movie and even though it is the most expensive movie ever made. it is nothing compared to Hollywood movies but with a budget of 30 million dollars the visual effects are astonishing comparing to The Matrix which had a budget of 300 million... I would recommend this movie to all of you even if you don't speak Tamil,Hindi or any other Indian languages."

At the age of 60,a man doing all things,seriously hats off,RAJNIKANTH,truly a unbelievable man to do this,amazing effort again,with shankar as director,first time bringing a new type of genre for Indians,with brilliant background scores decent fight sequences,best of best locations of song sequences,in typical rajni style,awesome.As a fan off rajni or shankar,100 % entertainment is guaranteed.The movie could have been better,to be perfect treat for non rajni fans.At the end of the day,one word is the effort paid off for its success.Watch it not only for rajni but shankar,the man who did this,amazing thinking and work.  7/10 for non rajni fans and 10/10 for rajni and shankar fans,i would go with 8/10.:)"

        "title": "Another of Shankar-Rajni mass masala. Watch it for the most for being the most sincere attempt in visual effects for an Indian film.",
        "review": "To be frank...as everyone, I had a lot of expectations.  The first few scenes when super star calls the small robot R2 actually added to my expectations since it was very rare that tributes find a place in Tamil films. But the moment I saw the conference scene where the public questions the lead character(déjà vu){Director Trademark} I knew that I was previously wrong with what I expected. Till then I was expecting or at least hoping that Endhiran would be the much awaited first Indian made sci-fi movie. But after the scene I knew that Enthiran will be another of Shankar's mass formula flicks( not on the negative side though). And it didn't actually disappoint. I turned out to be a pretty decent film with a \"Shankar and Rajini\" stamped all over it.  The first half of the film was good enough to keep everyone engaged, in spite of some silly \"comedys\" here and there especially those of Santhanam and Karunas. The roles of these two were completely unnecessary except for the scene in the second half {Director Trademark}(Chekov's gun you see...) where they help assemble Version 2.0 and the villain inserts the \"Red Chip\" ). It is factors like these and the 5 songs formula that bring down the quality of some pretty good* Indian films. Some of the scenes were really good especially the one where Chitti goes to the temple festival and picks up a fight. It has to be mentioned that concept of \"Electromagnetic mode\" which was first used in this scene(even though good) was overused throughout the movie (the train fight, the fire scene,the car chase scene, \"the Mask\" scene, and the last half an hour of the movie with all the formations) and these are scenes that characterize the movie( and the ones which gave the film so much hype when the trailers came out).  The second half of the movie was the one that made a huge difference between what I had expected before coming to the theater and the actual movie itself(it was the \"black sheep\"). It started with the worst scene in the movie, where Rajini switches to \"Mosquito mode\" and makes a deal with a mosquito to apologize to Aishwarya(the only consolation is that it is a \"tribute\" scene, the mosquito is named \"Ranga\" aka Sujatha). To be frank the first half of the movie could have been played by any other actor equally well, since it had some genuinely good scenes and even those didn't require you to be a Kamal or a Sivaji, but it was the second part of Enthiran which differentiates Rajini from all other actors( and answers the question \"why is Rajini more successful than Kamal?\"). Some of the best scenes in the movie like the \"black sheep\" scene don't look so great when you actually narrate the story to some one. But it is scenes like these and the usual \"pa..pa...paambu\" scenes that really makes you wonder wtf is so special with this guy. The movie continues with version2.0(skunk version of Alex Pandian) kidnapping Sana and making a fort for itself with numerous Rajini's protecting it (dont ask me how they all look the same). Even though the story was predictable till now the scenes had enough space in them for Rajini to expand and take over. The last half an hour of the movie, with all the formations suggested as if the director \"wanted\" the scene and stretched the movie to fit it in.{spoiler}(literally)The scene where Rajini tries to introduce a worm in to the network, which he created in less than ten seconds demoed the amateurish nature of Indian script writers when it comes to scifi. After all this struggle how does scientist Rajini stop the robot Rajini?? Introduce electromagnets again. The robot gets stuck in an electromagnet while hero Rajini presses the \"Eject Red Chip\" button specially made for him. No, not the end yet, after all what is a Shankar movie without a court scene in the end where its is proved that all the charges against the hero are unfair. Finally the rotten cherry on an already sloppy cake would be the final scene where Chitti dismantles itself and says \"Nattu Kazhandruchu\".{/spoiler}  The BGM of the movie has been brilliantly churned out by Rahman(as usual). At some places the BGM really adds to the feel of the scene, like \"Pudhiya Manidha\" with the \"Kadavul Irukkaru\" scene in the conference, the version 2.0 rap and the Arima arima bits in the end. Songs as usual reflect the grandeur of the film. {Director Trademark}. \"Kilimaanjaro\" looks a bit out of place and unnecessary. \"Arima arima\" deserves a special mention as one of the best songs of late and it really brought me back into the movie after some boring scenes in the 2nd half (after all...how many times have you seen the superstar as an extra?). Nice to see Aishwarya Rai back doing a Tamil film. She does justice to her character and has done exceedingly well with her dance moves especially in \"Irumbile\". The makeup man and the costume designers deserve accolades( apart from the uphill task of making Rajini look young) for making Aishwarya Rai look her beautiful best.  In short, technically Enthiran is easily the most sincere attempt by any Indian director(and of course the producer) till date, but emphasis on more important aspects like a strong script and intelligent screenplay instead of the time tested \"Shankar formula\" could have well taken the movie to a global audience. And for those so who say it was a \"different attempt\", i'd say Ayirathil Oruvan was a world better(although it lacked every other aspect). As of now, even though Enthiran is the costliest Indian movie, released in thousands of screens worldwide, scifi, blah blah blah...it still remains a movie for the masses. But I still highly recommend the film for having a feel of the best ever visual effects in an Indian film."

        "title": "Path-breaker for special effects in Indian Cinema",
        "review": "There is nothing that Rajni Can't is just one of those myriad SMS and email gags that go around. Although Rajnikant's antics really need no introduction, this time, his usual stuff is delegated to an android in his latest entry, 'Robot'.  Dr Vaseekaran, a robotics scientist, played by a professorial looking Rajnikant has worked for a decade developing a mechanical soldier for the Indian Army who is christened by his mother as Chitti also played by Rajni. Busy as he has been, he hardly has time for his lady love Sana (Aishwarya Rai), tad old to play a college girl though.  For Vasi to realize his dream, Chitti needs approval by an agency that is chaired by his mentor Dr Bohra (Danny) who rejects Chitti out of sheer jealousy and that the Robot cannot feel emotions. Now upgraded, Chitti starts to feel emotions. Predictably the Robot falls for Sana, putting the creator and his creation on the warpath.  Romance apart, the plot draws heavily from 'I-Robot' (2004) where it was about the Artificial Intelligence server finding creative interpretations to Asimov's 3 laws of Robotics. Something similar was also seen in last year's 'Eagle Eye'. Probably to avoid complication, or to make it palatable to romance-happy Indian Audience, the plot here is different. I'm also told that the story is based on a 70's Tamil novel.  A Rajni starrer that its, one can expect the usual overdose of drama. But, in his professorial role, this time, he chooses not to defy laws of Physics! It's the android that takes the center-stage and the film doesn't cut corners to make it seem realistic. The believable special effects have surely has taken Indian film-making to the next technological orbit; although with a little help from the folks from Hollywood.  AR Rahman's average fare is a let down. The story often breaking into a song-dance sequence every few minutes is hardly amusing. Of these, 'Kilimanjaro' deserves a special mention for its choice of Machu Picchu as the shooting location. Curiously, the song is named after a mountain located a third of the globe away!  Coming to casting, the average age of the lead pair is close to 50! Food for thought, huh! Those playing Rajni's sidekicks stick out like a sore thumb as they shamelessly call themselves scientists on screen and are hell bent on sabotaging the project and dish out woefully subterranean humor. The script definitely needed a lot more work.  Thus said, it's only fair to say that this is a review of 'Robot' and not that of 'Enthiran'. It's possible that a lot of humor and dialog must have been lost in translation."

The second half rails on different tone Rajinikant erupts his full capacity in acting.The mosquito scene is too a scientific fact it says the machine can communicate by frequencies.The culmination of the movie leaves us heavy hearted and take shame of human greediness for women and money.This is a science treasure for tech buffs.Songs are Extravagant!

        "review": "After all the criticisms about the movie I watched it plain hearted expecting nothing from the movie.  The movie was extraordinary in some aspects and just like other ancestor movies Bi-cental man, Terminator, I Robot (to be noted none of the movie in that list is a Tamil movie).  So we should appreciate the work done by the crew of Enthiran.  We just can't compare it with the above movies and find loop holes in the story.  First of all the visual effects in the movie was great.  Rajini's acting was to be right his effort has paid him well by making his fans a marvelous watching him on screen.  He has played three different roles (Dr.vasigaran, Chitti the Robot and Chitti the destruction Robot) I should say for which he has shown so many difference in his style, walk, mannerisms, dialogue delivery and the throw in his acting was simply a visual treat.  Coming to Aiswarya Rai Bachan who plays the love interest of all the above three roles of Rajini has made complete justice to her role \"The Lovely Sana\"  In the songs we cannot take off our eyes without watching her moves and her beauty was simply eye catching.  At the end of the movie everyone will definitely say she is the epitome of beauty.  As for as the songs and BGM A.R.R has rocked by giving us a nice album.  It was Viramuthu's words which is so robotic in hearing the songs particularly the no's like Arima and Irumbilae. Hats off to him.  At last it is the art and camera of Sabu Cyril and Randy was superb added class to the movie.  Overall it is the director who made it happen by his co ordination and ideas to bring up this huge budget film for the audience of India in Indian languages.  Well done.! My rating is 8.5 on 10"

        "review": "I'm a newcomer to Indian/Bollywood movies (my apologies if this isn't one). If you haven't seen one of these, this will be unlike anything you've ever seen before. It's a wonderful mix of science fiction, MTV, and comic book action (in the best sense).  It's finally showing in a few theaters in the US.  From the other reviews, you know the plot: scientist builds robot (mostly in his own image), designs it to do good (even though he wants the Army to use it). Chitti has a few problems dealing with humans and their language. (When a policeman asks for a \"cut\", instead of giving Chitti a parking ticket, Chitti happily obliges.) When the scientist's girlfriend is taking her final exams, he (and she) has no problems doing a little hi-tech cheating.  The movie - it runs almost 3 hours - is really in two parts: the first part deals with Chitti as a benevolent robot; in the second part, the \"evil scientist\" programs Chitti to be a \"destroyer\" - which leads to the most brilliant special effects seen in a long time (even for Bollywood) - and I think they draw a little on ancient Indian lore. There are a couple of references (and probably more) to Indian literature and history.  The \"MTV\" sequences are excellent - even though they have nothing to do with the movie. One on the better ones is shot at Machu Picchu: the two leads, a few lamas, a score of background dancers. That scene alone - with travel expenses - must have eaten up most of the budget.  I would put this one on anybody's \"must-see\" list."

        "review": "This is an excellent movie with  Subtle message   Superb Storyline   Oscar winning acting by SuperStar Rajnikanth in 4 dimensions (Scientist, Robot, Robot with feelings, and bad Robot).   Must watch for non-Indian folks who got used only to Bollywood movies or regular Hollywood movies.  One should see this movie to appreciate how the Indian movies outperform's English movies as it has strong storyline, entertainment, even in Sci-fi genre where the movie is watchable by the total family with no non-sense stuff"

        "review": "My all time favorite Rajni movie, it is the best sci-fi film ever made in India. The movie is a bit long, but it will surely keep you glued to the seats. It has all the elements, like humor, love, sentiments and all other cliché notions, watching Rajni Sir on screen is a treat. I was never so impressed with Aishwarya Rai, after watching Robot, it is certain, why the world adores her, she is gorgeous in the film...Chitti takes u by storm, he is an adorable character, where as the negative robot, too was well performed by Rajni. Background score is very good, songs are visually excellent, with virgin locations and thumping music. Overall, the film is a must watch and a guaranteed entertainment package, with a strong story line."

        "review": "Enthiran is definitely an unique attempt to showcase sci fi to the Indian audience. The movie has all the necessary ingredients to be understood by both the well educated and less educated. A really commendable effort by Shankar. The movie blends Romance, Comedy, Action and Thrill in the right doses. That is the reason for this movie running full houses at theater's in small villages in Tamil Nadu. Tamil cinema always has accepted fantasy genre. Mayabazaar, Patanathil Bootham are case and point for the same. If I were to classify this movie, this will have to be Sci Fi fantasy meets Romantic Comedy with Action thriller elements. Rajini the actor has shined. Shankar the director has done an unbelievable job. Sivaji the Boss: Rajini movie by Shankar Enthiran: Shankar movie by Rajini."

        "review": "Endhiran-As it is-->Deglamourised Rajni(scientist),Demotionalised Rajni(Robo),Villain Rajni(this one is good,but very less time like Mottai boss in the movie Sivaji.)Rajni is planning to transition from super star to super actor(like Amitabh Bachan?!)  Minus point 1.Rajni is lost in the big imagination of Shankar and production of SunTV. 2.Degalamourised Rajni(scientist),deemotionalised Rajni(Robo).(Now understood why Srk and Kamal refused this movie). 3.The starting is very simple,since the speed of movie doesn't increasing subsequently in a very high pace(like Mudalvan) this approach could have been avoided(pace build up is approach of Shankar). 4.Few logic flaws,Sana acting ignorant of Robo despite studying in a medical college,villain Rajni is not like Robo at all.(emotional Robo is like Moondru Mugam Rajni,a Shankar favorite) 5.Robo loving is the worst line in the movie,not interesting at all. 6.Rajni surrendering to Shankar and too much of underplay. 7.Simple Robo story been made with 162 crores and tto much publicity,hype(Robo stories in literature from 1896 and Hollywood flicks already seen bicentennial man,i Robot.Not sure on what different is,thats been hyped too much). 8.Instead of too much of research Shankar should have developed a good story line in second half(like the one in dasvatharam at least). 9.Could have had less CG shots and made in 50 crores with actor sharath,Rajni is not celebratable as its the emotion that is enjoyable,now its been minused when acted as Robo. 10.Not many interesting characters and events that are apart from Robo subject.Danny character not strong enough as villain.A interesting villain makeas a hero and a interesting story . 11.Frankenstein approach to Robo is the most repeated and boring thing in stories of literatures and cinema,now it comes in Tamil cinema,which isn't innovative at all.  Plus point 1.New Robo subject in Tamil films correctly at this media and internet age. 2.Villian Rajni 3.Climax story line of Robot making Robots and human Vasee gets mixed for thrill. 4.Climax action scenes-creative,quality. 5.Songs are OK. 6.Robot scenes excites at times and the comedy in it.Danny is also OK and casual. 7.Intellectually good on content at parts.(even though andro humanoid term is wrong!) 8.Good answer for Kamals Dasavatharam by Rajni,100 Rajnis appear in the movie: and Rajni as scientist and intellectual movie as like the Kamal's one."
