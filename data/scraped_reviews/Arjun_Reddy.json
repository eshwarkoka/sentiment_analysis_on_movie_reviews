        "review": "It has been a refreshing experience watching this movie. The romance, characterization is at its raw best. I am glad that the director and his team did not do anything to dial it down. The performances have been great. We all know the story, but it has not been done before in Telugu cinema. In some ways, this can be called modern Devdas with realistic dialogue.Without spoiling; the story is about a young MBBS student with anger management issues falling in love. Arjun Reddy's character is deeply flawed. I must appreciate the director and crew steering away from the Telugu movie way of showing the lead character in a perfect light. I am glad the character is flawed. There are several instances in this 186 minute movie that shows us the flawed side of our hero. It works out for the story telling. Also in this tale, we see characters yelling swear words when under stress or anger; which does not happen in other flicks.The physical romance couldn't be more appropriate. It's is present where necessary and only promotes story telling and emotions. Also, the story is also about a bunch of characters constantly caring and supporting Arjun Reddy despite his strong requirement for sole confinement. The sick kick friend is more than a side kick shows real spine in tense moments, also providing subtle comedy in the various situations. The movie does not commit to one message. The grandma says \"a person who wants to suffer must be left alone and that person will soon get back on his feet\"; But almost all characters related to the hero (Brother, friends) always keep visiting Arjun despite Arjun yelling them to go away. It was the supporting friends and family that bring back a almost lost soul back. When Arjun loses everything, left with no money and thrown on the road; it's the brother and father who spend their money to send Arjun to exotic countries to help him get over the girl.The movie doesn't seem 3 hour long, but definitely feels lengthy, often straining the eyes. Preethi's character is underdeveloped, but she did a decent job at that. The heroin side track was unnecessary and does not contribute much.Overall, this is a refreshing change in Tollywood and I can see a lot of directors experimenting by not following the Telugu formulaic trend in the upcoming years."

        "review": "Disclaimer: Not for telugu movie lovers who want 4 songs, 3 fights, couple of high budget sequences and 1 freaking mega family hero.This movie is an awesome mirror to how the present generation in India is. The story line, screenplay and the BGM are top notch.Movie starts off with the main character looking shoddy (like a modern day devadas) and his only intention is to flirt, f*** and finish off. it is only when you slowly slip into the movie that you realize that either you or one of your friends from college is of the same type. Anger management is the main theme of the movie and the director intelligently shows the difference in mindset of the character per and post falling in love.The supporting actors are like the friends of ours who are like shoulders to cry on or sit accordinglyGot to give credits to the Director for running the movie for full 3 hours without the distracting love duets/mass songs ( saved 25 mins of his time to convey the story better)The subject line is raw and to the point with the plot revolving only around the hero. At no point one feels bored (unless someone doesn't like the plot all together).BGM by the music director is amazing. it goes slowly and smoothly with the mood of the movieMain let down would be the climax: which looked hurried and commercialized for the movie buffs"

        "review": "Watch the teaser first: JAW DROPPING, then trailer GOOSEBUMPS and then the Movie (A MOVIE THAT'S GOT SOME B**LS). The Love story of Arjun Reddy was portrayed in such a dark &amp; intense way and hence I call it the CULT Classics of the Telugu Film Industry. The movie was goddamn natural (non-commercial) and watching it, i believe most of the people might have felt these emotions at some point of their lives. Its very hard to find such a Beautiful story in this commercialized movie world. Vijay's performance was flawless. His character takes you to your past and makes you cry, blood boil and heart melt. Some brilliant performance from supporting actors like Rahul who plays his best friend Shiva. I just loved Shiva's character as he is the Spinal Cord of the movie. Soul satisfying music. Hatsoff to Director Sandeep Vanga for introducing this kind of a movie to Telugu Film industry. Very good and important messages conveyed, much needed for this generation youth. The movie is a long 3 hour movie but is worth every minute. GO WATCH IT. I am lucky to have watched this movie #UNCENSORED."

        "rating": "10",
        "review": "The love in Arjun Reddy is pure, unabashedly bold and hard-hitting. It touches the soul in ways it can't be explained. It gives the story a modern-day Devdas twist, while making the overall cinematic experience a journey to remember for a long time.This is the story of the lead character Arjun Reddy(Vijay DeveraKonda), and yet there isn't a story, a structure to be precise, to follow and anticipate what might happen next. It's the rise, fall and rise of Arjun, and his journey of love and suffering, is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching.Sandeep and Vijay, as director and hero, make the film for what it is, and both have paved the way for a new chapter in Telugu film History. If it was Pellichoopulu and Kshanam last year, it's Arjun Reddy in 2017, and these films assure there is light at the end of the tunnel.As much as the film belongs to Sandeep, who is also its writer, it equally belongs to Vijay Devarakonda, who is the life of Arjun Reddy. Vijay breathes life into the character and it's impossible to imagine anyone else in his shoes. Be it his passion, love, and rage; he portrays these several layers of his character with unparalleled realism.Vijay's performance as a college-goer with serious anger issues or as the alcoholic surgeon will leave you in awe of his versatility in pulling off such diverse avatars with ease, as if it was child's play.Arjun Reddy most original, experimental and daring work to come out Telugu cinema in a long time."

        "rating": "10",
        "review": "Brilliant direction with organically written dialogues and an excellent cast. What stands out most in this film when compared to other Telugu films is the lack of hero worship, a story that lies close to reality and the portrayal of love in its pure form. Vijay uplifted the film to an entirely different level, giving it the kind of craze that it has. Radhan's music has done wonderfully with the frames and the scenes. Films like this would directly affect the Indian youth. The dialogues and the direction has made it clear that it is against the idea of objectifying women like most Telugu movies do with their item songs and unrealistic love stories which barely involve interaction on-screen. The protagonist has admirable qualities despite the fact that he has anger management issues and is, for a particular period, addicted to drinking. True love is timeless and tireless. No reason is strong enough for it to break, and this film showed us just that."

        "review": "The emotions in the love story are nothing more than kissing, and the word \"baby\". The protagonist always has some philosophy to cover up for the situation to prove that he is correct. The father/brother emotions are not sufficiently built. It would have been good if the brother characterization was built better, as to how he attempts to save his brother, or how the family would free him from drug addiction through showing of love. Overall, more of a story that dives deeper and deeper into tragedy. The boy is shown to be an excellent doctor. Even to excel in profession/academics, I believe a person would need to have a lot better self-control than what the protagonist seems to possess."

Sandeep is definitely a daring director, who has shown a new way forward with Arjun Reddy.This is Vijay Deverakonda's film all the way. He is sensational as Arjun Reddy. He completely transforms into the character and lives it. Undoubtedly, he is going to be the future poster-boy of Telugu cinema. He acts effortlessly, just like an experienced star. Rahul Ramakrishna as Vijay's friend is another surprise find, mouthing his dialogues in a natural way. Shalini makes an excellent debut, and shows no signs of being a newcomer. She is perfect for her role, which she carries with grace.Arjun Reddy, it sure is a sensation for Telugu cinema, and all the credit goes to director Sandeep for coming up with a subject like this. Although this is his debut film, one feels like he is an old hand. On his part, Vijay Deverakonda brings Arjun Reddy alive. A film not to be missed!!!"

He overdoses while his brother is getting high and shows no feelings when he ignores his brothers and fathers feelings for screwing up the wedding. The cherry on the top being the \"heroine\" is pregnant with his child. she also does not let her husband even touch her dirty clothes- her words not mine. Her father shows excellent judgement in diagnosing the Dbag but she still loves him any way. The people who made this movie seem to have trouble differentiating free spirit and a psychopath who also happens to be a douche. Save yourselves from hell!"

        "rating": "3",
        "review": "Ok, I am lost here, saw this movie yesterday after all that hype and hungaama and I really don't get how this film is truly different and mind-blowing! Are people only talking about the characterisation, which I will agree is quite strong and unapologetic. Vijay Deverakonda lives and breathes into this role. He is soo natural, almost too natural making us wonder if he has the same off-screen personality as well, which is a bit scary. Coming to the story, I am really not sure what the director wanted to convey. Did he want to tell us that it is bad being rude and acting on impulse .. and that such people strongly needs therapy?? I understand that Arjun Reddy has anger issues and acts impulsively, but it is soo stupid that his love interest, Preeti also does the same, where she was supposed to be the sane one. She gets married to some random dude, despite being totally in love with Arjun because he did not answer his phone for a single day due to a drug overdose!!!??? And this is what people are calling as a revolutionary cult classic!!! The second half is full of his downward spiral of Arjun Reddy and it is tedious watching this! Despite all his doings, he suddenly has flashes of remorse, especially in front of the lawyers and this is soo unconvincing. The ending saves this film a bit but makes all his suffering almost pointless. At any moment, Preeti could have ended his suffering instead we get a sub-plot with a film star thrown in and also countless moments where Arjun Reddy almost gets to kick the bucket!Really, all this could have been justifiable, if the conflict point between the two lovers was strong. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, it is the weakest aspect which brings the entire film down."

People are just praising this movie because they were just put into a corner and asked them to judge it by its advertised \"raw- bold- intense- and honest\" bull-sh*t words, which they have used it everywhere where ever the movie got advertised. Audience just couldn't decide what the F this movie is about. If you really ask an individual as to why they liked it, they will start searching for words and reasons and to their rescue the makers of this movie already have given them those words to public from day 1 of its trailer and they will start by saying \"its raw\" \"its bold\" \"its intense\" \"its honest\" \"its emotional\". People are out and out shy to admit that \"there's nothing much\" in this movie.. just F***n admit that this is a piece of SH** Just at least learn not to feel ashamed and admit that you do not see the point of this horrendous film."

        "title": " Over hyped film of immersive misogynistic narcissism",
        "rating": "8",
        "review": "This is the story of a guy and somewhat a girl, who are in deep love, develop strong relations, the girl getting married off to another, the guy getting addicted to booze, drugs, and a beard - an essential accessory for any Telugu film hero with disastrous love affair. The film starts with the hero (Vijay Sai Deverakonda) as a doctor in unkempt avatar with unpleasant characteristics. The provenance of the beard can be traced back to a violent fracas on football field, causing a showdown with a colourless dean. In defence, the hero serves up first of many infantile philosophies that pepper the film. He says \"Football is a violent sport\" (it is not), he plays for satisfaction, not medals. His friend who accompanies him, orders the class to stand up and \"respect the champion\". Every student stands up instantaneously as if national anthem has been set loose all of a sudden. They are so supine, scared, and scarred by the braggadocio of the guy who is permanently angry for no reason.However he is supposed to be great at sudies, excels in sports, eventually would do record operations even when drunk and drugged, and in spare time, when not emitting sexist rants, flies spaceships (I made up one of those). He also administers anatomical drawings on body, as a teaching aid, as if he were a modern day Vesalius. The director's idea of demonstrating keen intellect is to show him staring with keen anger while delivering juvenile banter as some sort of profoundness. Women are supposed to throw at his feet, even when he hits rock bottom, drunkard and jobless drug addict - such are these Telugu films.Enter, Preeti the first year fresher, who has instant anodyne effect on the hero. Ever since he is besotted with her, he marks her as his property by planting a kiss on her cheek without her consent. Later in the film, we would hear another insipid philosophical babble on his 'private space' that should be respected by others, of course, being a 'free spirit', he could invade others' space at will if they happen to be women. There starts the dog like devotion and aggressive possessiveness of the hero. In time honoured convention in Telugu films, the hero lays claim to her, 'protects' her from ragging predators. Warming up to dog motif, again, without her knowledge, people label her 'his girl', just as one would say 'his dog', which is a good template to understand his attitude towards her. Only thing he does not objectify is one real dog in the film, which is elevated to human, whereas the girl is downgraded to a faithful dog. In many scenes, you might as well replace the dog with the girl, as the dog barely barks and the girl rarely speaks. Then he hears of Preeti being marked rather inappropriately by another male dog during Holi celebrations. That heralds a sequence of rage filled obscene expletives which are now celebrated for being bold, raw, intense never before shown in Telugu films, director breaking the conventions of ordinary films making. The abuse is of course very conventional, targeting women, uttered by the hero (yes the same guy who would prattle pretentiously on how not to objectify women), to avenge the vile touch. The girl falls into his arms for protecting her honour, somewhat in Taliban style. And Telugu hero must acquire another essential accessory - a second heroine, of course with zero dignity. His treatment of her resembles kicking out a dog when he wanted to reject her.Showdown with the girl's father: The director often needs squalid characters to show hero in better light. The domineering father is a rank casteist stereotype who detests guy. He catches him kissing her at his home and angrily confronts him. By this time the director probably has convinced some good number of audience to fondly imagine that it is perfectly acceptable to visit someone's home, kiss their daughter and demand what the hero later blathers about as 'private space'. The girl's marriage is forcefully fixed and the hero gives her six hours to make up her mind to move out with him. What is the best way to reinforce his point to the woman? Slap her of course. He is medieval, but as we are told, he is a free spirit, so it is supposed to be ok.Then there is a ridiculous, completely out of context scene about PMS, contrived to show the audience how sensitive he is to female concerns, as if to tell 'I am not a sexist beast, I have this delicate side', crassly exploiting to extract brownie points. In another scene, the director makes him sermonise a moronic NRI not to objectify women. The characters surrounding the male lead are cardboard which is at least two dimensional. The hero is unidimensional, with angry face at one end, and pseudo empathetic drivel on the other.During his disciplinary hearings, he remembers Hippocratic oath, presenting himself as a guy with integrity. Such pangs of conscience! This guy does not remember the pledge we are drilled down in schools. \"All Indians are my brothers and sisters\". This sounds like kitsch, but intended to reflect fraternal spirit from the three pillars of Indian constitution - liberty, equality, fraternity. There is little fraternal feeling in this pledge loving bloke. When the girl's father asks him to look after his daughter like a \"sister\", he utters \"he does not have sisters\" in a pompous tone mocking Preeti's father for his old fashioned thinking. His own thinking or lack of it towards women is rather antediluvian. Even then, a character admiringly rambles that he has never seen a free spirit like this guy in a democracy. He neither understands free spirit, nor democracy (unless the free spirit means free booze), and spews this arrant nonsense. Coming to think of it, people in lunatic asylum are free spirits too. A man who needs a muse to be a lamb, but deforms into a brute ('free spirit') and loses self control when he loses her is fundamentally a weak person, though his brutishness appears as a sign of strength.While he is growing a beard, Preeti is growing his child, heavily pregnant. This is going to be film about beard, borne like a cross, not a potentially career ending silly pregnancy. A shawl would have added to the hero's pathos, but is too ethnic for our westernized pseudo progressive. He is an odious sociopath, but since he is handsome, needs escape route. Conveniently grandma dies, creating instantaneous transformation, faster than 2-minute noodles, manifested by the removal of that blasted beard. He is a changed man. Whatever changed, his propensity to deliver incomprehensible gibberish as philosophy does not cease, and his dad, mesmerised, has instant transformation himself (since loss of beard is the \"game changer\" of Telugu cinema). If only his friends found him a decent barber in time...never mind, better late than never.Anthony Hopkins as Dr.Hannibal Lecter remarks while lobotomising Ray Liotta's policeman that he did not need that part of the brain dealing with good manners. Our hero surely seemed to miss this part, even without a lobotomy, as demonstrated by his crude language with nurses, about patients, friends, especially regarding women. (By the way isn't Dr.Lecter a high end 'free spirit', with impeccable manners?). Once he asks his married classmate 'inkaa neellosukoledaa', enquiring about her pregnancy. When he sees a woman, he sees them as baby making machinery of future Arjun Reddys.Finally what did this path breaking film break? The dialogues sound casual without bombastic music. Nothing new, if one observed some old Telugu films (e.g. Rojulu maaraayi (1955), shaavukaru(1950) ). Story is banal, narration is dragging; comedy shines sometimes with outstanding Rahul Ramakrishna's Siva, but comic potential in Telugu films is enormous and not particularly novel. Songs: not having been bombarded with pre-release audio tracks to condition auricular senses, did not particularly find them greatly appealing. Much is made of Vijay Devarakonda's action, but superior performances come from Kanchana and Rahul Ramakrishna who transformed normal roles into scene stealing glue that holds this dismal film together. Maniacal roles are not the best yardsticks of performance. They inject more to the character than any acting. Batman's Joker is an example, with the actors having high chance of receiving high accolades! His performance is decent, but no better than in another of his recent films 'pelli choopulu' (2016). Then what is unique? This differs from others in using cuss words, peppering with obscene gratuitous expletives, under the pretence of showing realism, and the director is showered with epithets of 'bold' 'raw', 'honest'. Perhaps, dicing the film with even filthier language would have been termed \"bolder\". And of course, heavily publicised kissing (creating a very useful marketable controversy) . He also created one of the shallowest female leads, even by the abysmal standards of Telugu cinema, quite a feat. He is hailed as some sort of Sergei Eisenstein of Telugu films for this crudity. Forgot, there is another first by our Eisenstein. Never before seen piddling in the pants. Can any one beat that? Truly, \"bold\", \"raw\" , \"path breaking\" is alive and pissing. If you are not convinced by the dog motif mentioned earlier, this scene should confirm great canine like qualities of the hero, this time marking himself - a symbolic statement of his self indulgent narcissism. The ultra westernized tenor gives pretensions of modernity covering up misogynist behaviour. We can only expect more of such 'youth' films. On the opposite end, we have traditionalists who want to impose their own authority under the pretext of protecting women from western influences. Women will be caught out in a pincer movement of devil of and the deep blue sea."

        "review": "A window to peek into the mind of a brilliant medical student who fits the description of bipolar disorder and or borderline personality. Yes, a flawed personality. But, what's perfection anyway? The naming of the illness is unfortunate and when one can make a leap over and look past that, it's all about emotional dysregulation. When it comes to the naming of the film, it's apt as it narrates the story of the namesake and does just that, without judging or glorifying. Here too, one needs to look past the reservations against profanity, substance abuse, sexual intercourse etc..and better yet, come to terms with all of the above. A romantic at heart, passionate about what he loves, an idealist who can be reckless, arrogant and entitled too. A person who can see what could be and is conflicted with what is and can't deal with the reality with a calm composure. One who has little tolerance towards nonsense and lives by high expectations. A perfectionist who isn't perfect. A bipolar journey, where your mood dictates. The intensity of emotions is high. The art of embracing emotions and doing what is effective is absent. There is no consistency, as in life. The behavior is out of scale to the triggers as per the usual norm. A parted love draws him into a sombre place; a departed soul shakes him and sorts him out.Explosive, obsessive and compulsive, intolerant, substance-abusing, refusing help, humiliating people who help, belittling friends, failing to apologize - these just characterize his cries for help. When it comes to a medical surgery, he can get through successfully even when he is intoxicated. But when it comes to an emotion, he can't handle gracefully as expected by the society. His friend - who almost doubles as his therapist - knows his pain, helps him cope with the hurt especially when he doesn't like his choices or agree with his behavior and in spite of the insults he receives. He separates him from the behavior. It's hard to see that way and stay supportive. Which is what everyone deserves. Especially people with a mental illness need that kind of empathy to survive. It's hard to care for such an intelligent yet turbulent being. It's an imposition. There are no bad people, there is only bad behavior. There is always a cause. And a consequence. The lesson here is to understand pain, help to alleviate the suffering and then the biggest of them all...to forgive. It's all about empathy. He thinks he could have been a neurosurgeon if not for love and other distractions. I wish he were, he could've known the brain anatomy better, how his amygdala, hippocampus, insula or the prefrontal cortex work. The mere knowledge wouldn't help to prevent any behavior but that would definitely help handle the consequences better and might help manage his mental health better. A person who understands objectification of women and talks like a feminist, but at times, when it comes to his own love life, he acts like a predator, choosing his mate, making his moves, and marking his territory, almost abusive, dictating even who she needs to be friends with and violate her taking advantage of his senior status, almost coercing her to accept his stance. She doesn't fight back either and falls in love too. It almost feels like glorifying a lion and the lamb kind of a story. Almost doesn't count. So, let's give some benefit of the doubt. I wish there was more to the girl's characterization before their break up to clear any ambiguity. In a society where you are expected not to lose your virginity until you are married, where the concept of dating is still frowned upon and the religion you're born into (whether observed or not), caste system (whether you care or not) and financial status of your parents (which is irrelevant), food habits (by birth or by choice) even become objections to love. PMS is mentioned (although the failed mention that it's not always physical), pre-marital sex which is still a taboo is depicted, this movie is a litmus test to a society that still attributes virginity to women even more so than men, also, pregnancy which is normally attributed to the mother rather than the couple. A society where a mother can almost never have a conversation with her girl along the lines \"Have you guys kissed? Are you guys being safe?\" Above all, the terms and technicalities of the subject of mental health are completely alien or beyond comprehension for those who don't have first person exposure, which is the majority of such society. Despite the cinematic cop-out of a climax (except for the strength of the character to accept the baby before the truth is revealed ), it's not after all a promise to a \"happily lived ever after\" life. There will be more episodes in his life or he may not relapse at all. That's the nature of such disorders. There is no taking control or grit when comes to the ways of a brain. People do need to understand this. More than any other emotion, anger is the most complicated to fathom and to accept. Knowledge is out there for those who seek but wisdom is not a guarantee. And dare I say, this story holds true with a female protagonist too. A bipolar woman breaking up with her partner, suffering through the aftermath, making choices against the norm ...pregnant or not, who tries to move on or not, gets back together or not..it's all the same.I dream of the day when the world is no longer in need of feminism. I dream of the day when the intangible pain of the mind is given the same credence as bodily pain, if not more, and any disorder is mentioned without a negative connotation, and the stigma around mental illness truly disappears, and seeking therapy need not be a secret, resulting in better mental health."

        "rating": "8",
        "review": "Arjun Reddy (2017): Arjun Reddy got immense craze which is no less than the craze Kabali got.Youth went crazy after watching its trailers and posters especially because of its cuss words and kiss scenes which are quite bold to Telugu audience.But what came as a surprise is its realistic and honest portrayal of love stories.Plot: Arjun Reddy (Vijay Devarakonda), an ortho doctor has issues with alcoholism. He is an efficient ortho surgeon, but on the personal front, he is an alcoholic. And the reason for his turning into one is his love failure during his college days in Mangalore Medical College.While in college, he falls for first year student of MBBS. Preeti (Shalini) too likes him and their edgy love affair begins. Her father doesn't agree to their relationship and a huge tussle happens between Arjun Reddy and Preeti's family. This results in Preeti's father marrying her off to another person.After knowing that she got married, Arjun Reddy turns alcoholic and his anger issues further escalate. He becomes a modern-day version of Devdas who takes to alcohol, drugs, and tries to distance himself from the society.Rest of the story showcases the journey of Arjun Reddy as to how he regains his senses and gets back to normal.My Review: Arjun Reddy may have attracted audience with all the cuss words and smooches but it is one of the most realistic love stories in recent times.Arjun Reddy is like Kumari 21f of males.Sandeep Vanga has chosen an unconventional way to give new feel to audience.This is the story of the lead character Arjun Reddy, and yet there isn't a story, a structure to be precise, to follow and anticipate what might happen next. It's the rise, fall and rise of Arjun, and his journey of love and suffering, is nothing short of poetic and heart wrenching.Sandeep presents Vijay's character from different perspectives and from each point of view; we get to understand Arjun even better. For Arjun's father, his son's actions are stains on his prestige. For his friends, Arjun's actions show his recklessness and free-spirited attitude. For Preethi, Arjun's actions show his madness and unwillingness to change, which she eventually embraces.There are lot of amazing scenes in the movie which has immense depth in it.Especially the scene where Arjun rejects a guy who came to marry his friend's sister because that guy talks cheap about females.That shows the true nature of Arjun Reddy.The scene where heroine tries to calm down infuriated Arjun is one of the best scenes of the year.It's not the number of lip-locks or the use of expletives that make Arjun Reddy a brave film. What really makes it a brave film and its director, a man with guts, is that it ventures into a space Telugu cinema has dared to enter and I doubt if it will ever. It shows that any story, when told with conviction, will be accepted and celebrated.But the major drawback is its lengthy duration which is 3hr 06 min.Almost 30mins of the movie can be edited out as most of the scenes feel repetitive in second half.It is clear that director did not want to lose any detail of Arjun reddy's fictional life but he should have written some strong scenes which are entirely missing which make us feel Arjun's pain.Vijay Devarakonda stuns you with his performance which is surely award winning. The way he brings the pathos and pain in his character is something else and drives the film completely. His dialogue delivery, the aggression he shows and the emotional manner in which he showcases his love is superb.Vijay's performance as a college-goer with serious anger issues or as the alcoholic surgeon will leave you in awe of his versatility in pulling off such diverse avatars with ease, as if it was child's play.Rama Krishna who played Arjun's friend is brilliant as he entertains with his witty dialogues reactions.Actress Shalini may not look pretty but gave good performance.Yesteryear actress Kanchana is very good in the role of free-spirited grandma.Songs are good but its the BGM which is the soul of the movie.It elevated proceedings in brilliant way.So,Arjun Reddy is a raw and honest take on youthful love stories with award-winning performance from Vijay Sai Devarakonda.My rating 7.5/10"

        "review": "The movie is all about the attitude of Arjun Reddy,his love,ambitious way,especially anger guy. In telugu industry we don't seem this kind of movies for past decades. A trend have to introuduce as of moment in telugu. Vijay Devarakonda and Direction,Story,Screenplay are the Heart of the movie. We cant take down any of these. Vijay perfection acting felt us a different guy in T'town and finally got Star crazy. Direction appreciable, new guy to industry where he puts whole heart and has given master piece to telugu people. The movie is out standing of every character so many characters relative to real life especially telangana local language used in very descent. Actress wow she is good supporter and Friend Character of Hero was impressed us so much. All elements put in the movies. only thing is Its a youth movie A Certified but all centers people loved this and smash hit this time. I hope to get so many awards and rewards to this film. Till so many appreciations from critics also. I hope so strong Vijay will be the Best actor in filmfare awards where he missed the award with pelli choopulu. Vijay acting in a failure lover character is really great much"

        "rating": "3",
        "review": "Arjun Reddy from the starting scene tells us that this movie is not going to be a normal travel. Be it the actors looks, attitude,dialogues the movie will go places. Vijay Devarkonda kills the performance and he has perfectly executed the 3 roles in the film. The film dialogues are good it increases the engagement of the movie. The movie is a bit lengthy and they have managed to engage the audience throughout the film but in some places the melodrama becomes very low. The director needs to be appreciated for his way of telling the story and handling of emotions. Supporting cast have done their job perfectly and to sum it up Arjun Reddy is a normal story but told in a different way which will make the audience worth the money."

        "rating": "10",
        "review": "It's a sad feeling that you get coming out of the theater, similar to what the main protagonist experiences throughout majority of the running time of the movie (whopping 3 hours). It's sad because such an unconventional, daring,bold, courageous movie couldn't come out if the shackles of a typical mainstream climax. Wish you could erase the final few minutes of the movie and rewrite the script to something mature and inspirational. But having said that, you would have experienced something that very rarely comes out of Telugu or Indian Cinema already which deserves rich applause to mainly the director and the male lead( which I'm sure is coming).The movie just takes off from the word go where in flashbacks, we're introduced to a good looking,hot headed, topper in the final year of his medical college. He openly dares the dean, other medicos, gets violent very often and has all the habits a doctor shouldn't have. Still he is feared and revered by all. The scenes in the college where he falls for a fresher, the ragging, romance are all shot boldly with immense realism and shock value. But somehow you connect with the male lead who is his worst enemy. The director displays the same \"I care for none\" attitude throughout the film and you hardly get time to digest the new age, open and bold dialogues (majority beeped), PDAs &amp; fights, but still you feel for the love story when it goes awry. That is where the hero and the film start a downhill course. You don't get to feel the real reason for the separation and subsequent pain, suffering, indulgence,recklessness, but that only a minor flaw because Vijay Sai makes you feel his pain and gives a character to root for even as he slides and slides into a deep pit.it is probably his best lifetime performance. The sidekick is fantastic as well even through the dark phases of drugs, alcohol, women and the rest. Alas,we don't get any perspective from the female side which is fine till out of nowhere you get a story which is unrelatable at the end. The music and background score are one of the highlights,so are the performances of all actors. The editing makes the movie overlong &amp; repetitive. Kudos to the director to have done research about the medical field and for a very intelligent yet realistic premise which is hugely promising. It is flawed on a few counts but if you could wipe out those parts you will be thoroughly entertained."

        "rating": "9",
        "review": "The movie is too raw. Also, there's nothing too great about the story. For the most part, it's nothing but smoking and drinking-plain. Movies have a profound influence on the society and I believe that the directors should feel responsible when they're portraying situations or activities that leave a deep impact on the young impressionable minds. If it wasn't for the ending I wouldn't have cared to give this a negative rating. Pain exists when things don't turn our way but it need not be shown in a vulgar fashion to say that the pain is intense. And the 3* I gave was for the ending. For the rest, its 0. I know that most of the readers who go through this may not agree with me, at all. But, this is what I feel."
